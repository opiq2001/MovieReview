ACHMAD FAUZI (1302140044),"Twitter is one of the social media that is currently popularly used around the world. It's just that twitter has some problems that adversely affect its users. Hoax is one of the negative things that often occur in social media, news in the hoax is still doubted the truth or the fact. In this research, the authors built a system to detect hoax news on twitter. The use of the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting system in the system gives a weighted value to a tweet taken from the occurrence of a hoax news sent by someone on Twitter. Data classification uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method of the system to predict the possibility of a twitter account user spreading a hoax news based on the user's behavior. Testing data is done based on the contents of content tweets. Datasets are arranged based on attributes used such as the number of retweets, URLs, number of hashtags, provocations, hostility, anxieties, and unbalanced news. Processed data is divided into training data and testing data. The result of data using all features get the highest accuracy is 78,33 .","['data', 'twitter', 'hoax']"
ACHMAD KHALIF HAKIM (2103139013),"??? This paper proposes the new method for improving the accuracy of detection of DDoS attacks on the SDN by utilizing control plane using Six-Sigma method. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a centralized network control system. This system offers flexibility on receiving, processing and forwarding packets between sub networks. The centralized system of SDN, which separates control plane and data plan, has an immense number of advantages, but it also has the risk of becoming a single point of network failure. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the major issues faced in the security aspect of SDN. This attack can make network resources unreachable by the true packets. The widely known method has been implemented on SDN for avoiding DDoS attack is Three-Sigma method. Three-Sigma method uses threshold value to determine the existence of DDoS attack. However, this method has drawbacks in terms of accuracy in determining the DDoS attack. Main contribution of this paper is utilizing central control plane of SDN for improving accuracy on detecting DDoS attack. Several experiments have been performed for proving the concept. The result shows the new method can improve the accuracy of detection of DDoS attack, either in constant or fluctuating traffic, by reducing the false positive. The performance is about 50 more accurate than the previous method","['method', 'ddos', 'attack']"
ADE SUTEDI (2301150014),"Community Question-Answering (CQA) is one of the online forums where user allowed to ask the question and the other users can reply related to the question problems. Due to CQA has no restrictions in conveying questions or comments, there are comments that did not appropriate with the problems. To solve these problems, combining lexical and semantic features has been developed with result conclude that the approach more adequate for similarity task rather than question answering. According to the previous research, there are several problems that can be enhanced. First, vector representation counts exactly matched words, it does not effective to cover other words that have relatedness between two pairing words. Second, noun overlap for similarity measure in pairing words can???t define that the two words are similar. So, it must be defined that the pairing POS tag is the same meaning or relatedness. In this study, unsupervised lexical and semantic similarity method employed with a different approach from the previous method in verbatim and contextual similarities. The data was taken from SemEval 2017 competition which focuses on Question-Answer Similarity task. The experiment result for precision (Mean Average Precision) score shows the significant improvement from 0.6742 to 0.6845, 1.03 higher than previous research in CQA. This improvement comes from lexical similarity, which is not just from noun pattern but also taken from verb pattern. Furthermore, semantic similarity has an important role in determining which words that have the same pattern and meaning to define relevancy between them.","['similarity', 'words', 'question']"

AGUNG RAHMAT BUDIMAN (1301144142),"Motorcycle is the highest contributor of a traffic accident in Indonesia which 83 of it caused by human factors. These human factors include traffic signs violation and riding above the speed limit. Besides that, road condition also affects traffic accident, such as a pothole, speed bump and lack of traffic signs. In the case of a fatality, the highest proportion of fatalities is 22.4 of the total 145,478 victims occurred in 2011. Head injury is the main factor of casualties by 70 . Based on these statistics, the role of a helmet as a head protector must be worn by motorcycle riders and make sure the strap perfectly locked. To overcome this problem, this study introduces a smart helmet system to warn the rider when they meet dangerous factors that risk causing traffic accident. These factors are when the rider has not worn the helmet and lock the strap and speeding above the speed limit. Other than that, this study offers a new feature to warn the rider when passing through the obstacle such as potholes or speed bump at unsafe speed. This feature is offered because of the bad road condition in Indonesia contributes to traffic accidents. From the test???s results, the smart helmet system in this study has an average response time of 1.4 seconds in the helmet use and strap lock detection system and 0.3 seconds in speed and shock detection system. In addition, the average difference of speed calculation between smart helmets and GPS is 3.3 km/hour.","['speed', 'traffic', 'helmet']"
"AGUNG TOTO WIBOWO (NIP: 06810035-1, NIDN: 0407088102)","Recommender systems have been widely applied in the literature to suggest individual items to users. In this paper, we consider the harder problem of package recommendation, where items are recommended together as a package. We focus on the clothing domain, where a package recommendation involves a combination of a top (e.g. a shirt) and a bottom (e.g. a pair of trousers). The novelty in this work is that we combined matrix factorisation methods for collaborative filtering with hand-crafted and learnt fashion constraints on combining item features such as colour, formality and patterns. Finally, to better understand where the algorithms are underperforming, we conducted focus groups, which lead to deeper insights into how to use constraints to improve package recommendation in this domain. Recommender system explanations have been widely studied in the context of recommending individual items to users. In this paper, we present and evaluate explanations for the more complex problem of package recommendation, where a combination of items that go well together are recommended as a package. We report the results of an empirical user study where participants try to select the most appropriate combination of a ``top'' (e.g. a shirt) and a ``bottom'' (e.g. a pair of trousers) for a hypothetical user based on one of 5 types of explanation communicating item-feature preferences and/or appropriateness of feature combinations. We found that the type of explanation significantly impacted decision time and resulted in selection of different packages, but found no difference in how participants appraised the different explanation types.","['package', 'items', '(eg']"

AKHMAD SAIFULLAH (1301144242),"Bandung is a region in Indonesia that has good potential tourism. Every year, the number of tourists coming to Bandung is increasing. However, most tourists do not have enough information to organize a tour for visiting several touristic places. Therefor a system for tour scheduling is needed to help tourist to enjoy their holiday. Here, we develop a tour scheduling system using the Firefly Algorithm. This algorithm generally is used to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The Firefly algorithm generates tour scheduling based on three criteria of user needs, such as distance, popularity and budget. We calculate these three criteria with the Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). Each criterion has a priority value from user. We use the result of MAUT as a fitness of Firefly Algorithm. The Firefly algorithm also considers opening hours and closing hours for each tourist attractions. This system also recommends some hotels based on two criteria, i.e., distance and facilities. We calculate these two criteria using MAUT. For evaluation, we compare n-days tour scheduling modeled by one step optimization, with per-day tour optimization (n-steps). We employ some parameters, i.e., running time, fitness value and number of visited destinations. Based on the experiment, the running time of per-day tour optimization is 7 faster than one-step optimization. Meanwhile, the fitness value of per-day tour optimization is 14 higher than one-step optimization. In addition, the number of nodes in tour of per-day tour optimization is 30 more than one step optimization.

Specify, the requirement to quantify risk discovers in many different contexts. For instance, a regulator measures the risk exposure of a government institution in order to determine the maximum value from any phenomenon occured as a tool against unexpected losses. Particular attention will be given to Value-at-Risk (V@R). Mostly, implementation of V@R is in financial cases, as an potential alarm of institution to anticipate the magnitude of risk. Combining V@R with the forecast function of AR-ARCH model, this paper proposes a new implementation of estimative-V@R and improved-V@R to compute heavy rain as representation of worst weather, which has the same future goal providing funds to anticipate financial losses. There are limited researches related to heavy rain forecast based on constructing a model by considering risk of with modifying some mathematics equations. We consider an overview of the existing approaches to measure V@R of weather data involving time series process and some stochastic expansion. We present V@R using AR and heteroscedastic procees ARCH considering the changes of data volatility. We consider an estimative prediction limit to determine an improved prediction limit with better conditional coverage properties. The parameter estimator of AR-ARCH is assumed to have the same asymptotic distribution as the conditional maximum likelihood estimator.

There are several methods for securing the exchanged information such as was proposed by Rejani et al. Rejani???s method can be noiseless in low capacity but noisy in high capacity. In the case of high capacity, it will raise suspicion. This research proposed a method based on histogram and pixel pattern for keeping the stego image noiseless while still keeping the capacity high. Secret information can be embedded into the cover by evaluating the histogram and map the characters used in the secret message to the consecutive intensity in the cover image histogram. The map of the characters is sent to the recipient securely. Using the proposed method there is no pixel value changes during the embedding process. Based on the result of the experiments, it is shown that in noiseless condition, the proposed method has higher embedding capacity than Rejani???s especially when using cover image with sizes larger than 128 ?? 128. Thus, in noiseless condition the embedding capacity using the proposed method is higher than Rejani???s method in noiseless condition. An important problem in visual cryptography is the alignment problem. Although Liu, et al. have proposed a method for aligning the shares, there is still a problem with the non-identical mathematical support visual cryptography schemes.

As the baseline, a Confix-Stripping Approach that applies Porter Stemmer for the Indonesian language was used. This stemmer shares similarities in terms of affix type, but uses a different stemming order. To observe whether the baseline stems the Sundanese affixed word properly, some features that were not covered by the baseline, such as the infix and allomorph removal, were added. The evaluation was done using 4,453 unique affixed words collected from Sundanese online magazines.

Ahmed Aliyu,"Multipath video streaming in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) is an evolving research topic. The adoption of video transmission in VANETs communication has become essential due to the comprehensiveness and applicability of video data for on-road advertisement and infotainment. Meanwhile, several research studies have considered how to apply and improve the transmission of the video quality. Due to this, the concurrent multipath transmission has been employed in order to achieve load balancing and path diversity, because of the high data rate of the video data. However, the main nature of the road, which is the pathway for VANET nodes has not been considered explicitly. In this paper, the road features are considered for VANETs multipath video streaming based on the greedy geographical routing protocol. Thus, VANETs Multipath Video Streaming based on Road Features (VMVS-RF) protocol has been proposed. The protocol was compared with an ordinary Multipath Video Streaming (MVS). The result demonstrates that the proposed VMVS-RF protocol outperforms the MVS in terms of Data Receiving Rate (DRR), Structural Similarity (SSIM) index and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR).

Diabetes mellitus is a health disorder in which the level of sugar in a person's blood is getting higher due to the lack of insulin or insulin receptors in the body do not properly function. Indonesia ranks the 4th largest in the number of Diabetes Mellitus sufferers in the world. Many people initially did not know that they had diabetes mellitus and only found out that they had had diabetes after experiencing some complications in some organs of the body. To predict blood sugar levels, this study tries to use one method of probability approach, i.e. Markov chain. It is a calculation technique that is commonly applied in modeling many conditions so that this technique is applied to help predict changes that might occur in the future. The results of the analysis applying this method could predict blood sugar levels, which then the results can be used as material or basis for creating a system that is able to help people affected by diabetes mellitus in predicting the high and the low of blood sugar levels. The tea plants (Camellia Sinensis) are small tree species that use leaves and leaf buds to produce tea harvested through a monoculture system. It is an agriculture practice to cultivate one types of crop or livestock, variety or breed on a farm annually. Moreover, the emergence of pests, pathogens and diseases cause serious damages to tea plants significantly to its productivity and quality to optimum worst. All parts of the tea plant such as leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits are exposed to these harm lead to loss of yield 7 until 10 per year. The intensity of these attacks vary greatly on particular climate, the degree slope and the plant material used. Therefore, this study analyzes tea leaves as a common part used in recipes to create unique taste and flavor in tea production, especially in agro-industry. The decision making method used is Fuzzy Mamdani Inference as one of model with functional hierarchy with initial input based on established criteria. Fuzzy logic will provide tolerance to the set of value, so that small changes will not result in significant category differences, only affect the membership level on the variable value. Previous method using probabilities have shown 78 tea leaves have been attacked by category C (Gray Blight) while using Mamdani indicated 86 of tea leaves have been infected. In this case, this result pointed out that Fuzzy Mamdani Inferences have more optimal result compare to the previous method.

Arnida L. Latifah,"The capacity of a global gridded climate data in describing tropical cyclone (TC) activity might be still less adequate due to its coarse resolution or the TC intensity itself. Grid refinement method such as a dynamical downscaling is one way to add values of the climate attributes in the data. However, the performance of the dynamical downscaling itself still contains many uncertainties. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the dynamical downscaling model on the climate simulation during a strong tropical cyclone Haiyan. The snapshots and the best track data from the historical satellite imagery will be used for validation. In general the downscaled cyclone simulation does not give a significant change to the driven data, but it results in more finer resolution of wind field and improves the time and the position of the eye of the cyclone.","['cyclone', 'climate', 'data']"

Color segmentation and image morphology are stacked with a more advanced supervised learning cascade classifier. In this way, the favorable color segmentation and image morphology help to reduce the number of object candidates while the cascade classifier helps to boost the accuracy of detection. For localization, the field is divided into pre-defined grids and employing KNN (k-nearest neighbor) to determine the robot location in the grids. Pre-defined grids are used to reduce computation due to matching with a map. Experiments show encouraging result for detecting field and ball position. Our approach has successfully been implemented in practice and achieves the first winner in Indonesian humanoid robot soccer competition. This paper investigates balancing control of a humanoid robot in soccer application. Many works have been developed to solve balancing control using specific body parts movements while in a standing position. While for small disturbance have shown well, but for quite large disturbance has limited performance. In this paper, we focus on using the slight movement of a robot when quite large disturbance is applied. The robot slightly moves its position to the same direction of the disturbance. Slightly moves of the robot seems more natural with how human perform balancing when receive quite large disturbance. We implement this on our humanoid robot soccer platform. This method is to adjust the step position of the humanoid robot???s leg when getting external perturbation to remain the robot in a standing condition. By reprocessing the inverted pendulum control formula, we get the relation between the angular acceleration and the step that the robot should perform. Experiments show that with this strategy our robot platform can prevent itself from falling as twice as better than before.

At present most of the water filter technology is still manual where there is no automation in the backwash function and to monitor water quality before and after filtering. The backwash function is a way to clean the filter media with clean water by changing the direction of the water flow, with the aim of cleaning the filter media from the residue after the filtration process. Normally, the turbidity level of water must be below 25 NTU with a pH between 6-8. In this study a system has been developed to monitor turbidity levels on water filters and apply the Fuzzy Logic control method to regulate the backwash process when the filter media is very dirty or very saturated so that the turbidity level of water in the filter output exceeds the standard NTU limit. In addition, fuzzy controls are also used to cover the inlet of the drains to the filter when the pH level of the water is not in accordance with the normal pH. The lifting of sediments at the bottom of the reservoir caused by vertical currents causes rapid mass mortality of fish. The sediment, which is mostly fish excrement and feed residue, causes the DO content in the water surface to drop dramatically from the normal value of 3-6 mg / L to below 1 mg / L. This vertical current condition is referred to as upwelling of the reservoir. The occurrence of upwelling in freshwater waters can be predicted from factors of difference in surface temperature and under surface temperatures, DO levels and pH levels. Upwelling will occur if the temperature difference between surface temperature and underwater temperature reaches> 5??C for more than 11 hours. The system for detecting upwelling is built on Internet of Things (IoT) communications by utilizing a fuzzy logic decision system. The reading of data from temperature, DO, and pH sensors is sent to the microcontroller device and delivered to the end user via the Internet network. Fuzzy logic implanted on microcontroller device to get the decision condition is not upwelling, potentially upwelling, and upwelling occurs. Upwelling detection systems are tested in reservoirs and in test environments. From the test results the system successfully read data, process data, and send to users without any data lost or damaged.","['water', 'fuzzy', 'yang']"

Bander Ali Saleh Al-rimy,"Crypto-ransomware employs the cryptography to lock user personal files and demands ransom to release them. By utilizing several technological utilities like cyber-currency and cloud-based developing platforms, crypto-ransomware has gained high popularity among adversaries. Motivated by the monetary revenue, crypto-ransomware developers continuously produce many variants of such malicious programs to evade the detection. Consequently, the rate of crypto-ransomware novel attacks is continuously increasing. As such, it is imperative for detection solutions to be able to discover these novel attacks, also called zero-day attacks. While anomaly detection-based solutions are able to deal with this problem, they suffer the high rate of false alarms. Thus, this paper puts forward a detection model that incorporates anomaly with behavioral detection approaches. In this model, two types of detection estimators were built. The first type is an ensemble of behavioral-based classifiers whereas the second type is an anomaly-based estimator. The decisions of both types of estimators were combined using fusion technique. The proposed model is able to detect the novel attack while maintaining low false alarms rate. By applying the proposed model, the detection rate was increased from 96 to 99 and the false positive rate was as low as 2.4 .","['detection', 'rate', 'crypto-ransomware']"
Bo Liu,"Modern seismic data surveys generate terabytes of data daily leading to a significant increase of the cost for storage and transmission. Therefore, it is desired to compress seismic data. In this work, we propose a model-based compression scheme to deal with the large data volume. First, each seismic trace is modeled as a superposition of multiple exponentially decaying sinusoidal waves (EDSWs). Each EDSW represents a model component and is defined by a set of parameters. Secondly, a parameter estimation algorithm for this model is proposed using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. In the proposed algorithm, the parameters of each EDSW are estimated sequentially wave by wave. A suitable number of model components for each trace is determined according to the level of the residuals energy. The proposed model based compression scheme is then experimentally compared with the discrete Cosine transform (DCT) on a real seismic data. The proposed model based algorithm outperforms the DCT in term of compression ratio and reconstruction quality.","['data', 'model', 'seismic']"

Integrated architecture based on partitioned system with hierarchical scheduling is referred as real time hierarchical system which is a solution to increase ef???ciency in terms of hardware cost and size. This approach increasing the complexity of the integration process including the handling of faults. In this paper the authors describe a proposal with three components for dealing with fault tolerant in real time hierarchical systems by handling fault in task level, partition level and distributed level. The contribution of this proposal is the mechanism for building fault tolerant system on real time hierarchical system. Aircraft Data Network (ADN) is a data communication developed specifically for the aircraft environment. Such environment requires data communication system that can work in real-time and has a high level of reliability. One of the standards in ADN is Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) based on the ARINC 664 specification being data communication standard for ADN utilizing IEEE 802.3 standard on physical layer 1 and 2. There are some challenges to implement the standard on the component of COTS By utilizing Linux-based embedded systems. The features designed and implemented in this paper are the switching and fault tolerant data components of ARINC 664. From the tests obtained, there are several results showing that ADN functional features can be implemented and can simulate ADN mechanisms including fault tolerant capabilities. However, there are performance limitations exemplified by the obtained average jitter value of 3380 microseconds not meeting the requirements for aircraft use required to have the range of 500 microseconds.","['system', 'fault', 'data']"

In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner???s profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability.

In the scheme, the grid of surface elevation is different that the grid for the velocity. We combine second order spatial discretization and 1st order upwind conditions for the total depth and the velocity variables for simulating accurately runup phenomenon. In the implementation, a special treatment is given for solving the elliptic equation of the Boussinesq model, i.e. so-called thin layer method. To test the performance of the implementation, we simulate three runup cases, i.e. runup experiments by Synolakis 1992 for non-breaking and breaking case, and a runup case proposed by Carrier & Greenspan 1958. Moreover, to show the performance of the implementation for simulating effects of dispersion and nonlinearity, we simulate propagation of broad band waves, i.e. focusing wave group and irregular wave. Results of simulation agree quite well with experimental data from hydrodynamic laboratory. An accurate water wave model with breaking capability is important for accurate prediction of wave evolution especially when the wave approaching shallower water. Not only accuracy in the dispersion relation of the wave model that is important, the nonlinearity of the model also plays significant role in representing effect of wave shoaling. In this paper, we simulate propagation of breaking regular and irregular wave above a sloping bottom by using a dispersive wave model so-called variational Boussinesq model. Results of simulation are compared with experimental data from a hydrodynamic laboratory. We discuss effects of wave energy transfer from main wave frequencies to higher order frequencies when wave reaching shallower water and breaking. In this paper solitary wave attenuation by vegetation is investigated by using numerical simulation. To take into account effects of dispersion, we use a dispersive and nonlinear wave mode; the non-hydrostatic with 1 layer. The damping by vegetation is modelled by using mean drag force using Morison formula. The dissipative term is added in the momentum equation. The wave model is implemented numerically using finite volume with momentum conservative staggered grid scheme. To test the numerical scheme implementation, we simulate a solitary wave attenuation by vegetation that proposed by Huang et al. 2011 [2]. Comparison with experimental data shows that the results of simulation agree quite well. This paper discusses extreme magnitudes of residual water levels and their probabilistic behaviors. The study area is situated in the west of Java Sea, NW of Java Island. The discussion relies on recent two decades??? Sea Surface Height (SSH) from two offshore points of observation in the west of Java Sea and Water Level (WL) from a tide station in Tanjung Priok port of Jakarta. The dataset of SSH is obtained by satellite altimetry on 10-day basis observation, while WL is recorded on hourly basis. Residuals are extracted from SSH and WL by removing their mean values (i.e. Mean Sea Surface, Mean Sea Level) and the tide. They range within the order of sub-meters. These count already for at least one-third of the tidal amplitude in the region. To these residuals, their mean and extreme patterns are explored. The chances of positive residuals are at least tripled with respect to the negative ones. The nearshore point, i.e. Tanjung Priok, experiences a greater magnitude of residuals than those in the offshore area. Here, we apply Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) methods respectively for Block Maxima/Minima (BM) and Peak Over Threshold (POT) samplings of residuals. It is found that, the extreme positive and negative residuals at 100-year return period are within less than ??1???m in Tanjung Priok and just less than half-meter in the offshore area. While higher residuals are observed during the East monsoon in the offshore area, Tanjung Priok experiences higher residuals during the West monsoon. This is thought due to the prevailing wave fields, which are governed by the monsoonal winds.","['wave', 'residuals', 'model']"

While nearest neighbor queries are commonly used in outdoor, it is hard to be implemented in indoor space due to lack of geo-positioning system that can be used in indoor space.Moreover, the network structure and the objects of interests types in indoor environment make nearest neighbor query difficult to implemented straight away in indoor environment. This paper adapts nearest neighbor query in indoor space for inter-building environment without geo-positioning and discover the shortest path to nearest object. Our experiment shows that nearest neighbor query could be adapted in indoor spaces by using road network in indoor and implement routing algorithm for routing to the nearest object.","['nearest', 'indoor', 'neighbor']"

It is a challenge to find the suitable characteristic of MANET protocol which conforms to a certain network condition scenario. Generally, many studies have been done to analyze the performance of MANET protocol. However, those studies are related to the scope of topology-based protocol. Based on that scope, the easy way to explore the MANET protocol is to compare between the Proactive protocol and the Reactive protocol. Alternatively, there is a protocol which is a combination of both, namely the Hybrid protocol. Studies which are related to the comparison between the Proactive protocol and the Hybrid protocol, or reviews which are related to the comparison between the Reactive protocol and Hybrid protocol have been widely executed. Nonetheless, there are still little studies related to the MANET protocol which focus on the character of its energy usage. Based on this information, this study is going to analyze about the comparison of energy usage in the MANET network between the Proactive which is performed by OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing Protocol) and the Hybrid which is presented by ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol). This study gives a result that the ZRP total energy consumption is fewer than the OLSR total energy consumption, nevertheless when the destination nodes are located in the sender nodes radius area, the OLSR can maintain its energy use better than the ZRP.","['protocol', 'manet', 'energy']"

EDWINA ANKY PARANDE (1301140384),"An automatic syllabification, decomposing a word into syllables, is an important part in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) that uses both syllable-based acoustic and language models. It can be performed to either phoneme or grapheme sequences. The phonemic syllabification is more complex than the other since it requires a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) as a previous process. It generally gives a high accuracy for many formal words but its accuracy may decrease for person-names. In contrast, the graphemic syllabification is simpler and more potential to be applied for person-names. This research focuses on developing a model of graphemic syllabification using a combination of phonotactic rules and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbour in every Class (FkNNC). The phonotactic rules are designed to find some deterministic syllabification points while FkNNC, as a statistical classifier, is expected to search the remaining stochastic syllabification points. A recovery procedure is proposed to correct the wrong syllabification points produced by FkNNC. Five-fold cross-validating on a dataset of 50 k formal words, selected from the great dictionary of the Indonesian language, shows that the proposed model gives syllable error rate (SER) of 2.48 and the proposed recovery procedure reduces the SER to be 2.27 , which is higher than that produced by the phonemic syllabification (only 0.99 ). But, this model is capable of handling a dataset of 15 k high variance person-names with SER of 7.45 and the proposed recovery procedure reduces the SER to be 6.78 .","['syllabification', 'proposed', 'person-names']"

Given a number of destinations to be visited by a traveler, his/her accommodation location, the duration of his/her visit, and some constraints for each destination, a travel plan application is expected to create a schedule for visiting the chosen destinations. Determining such a schedule manually is a tedious and time-consuming task due to the algorithm complexity which falls in O(n!) if the problem is to be solved by using brute force approach. In this research, the problem is treated as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and solved using genetic algorithm (GA), which has been widely known to be capable of solving combinatorial problems. However, to employ GA in travel planning, there are challenges in determining the appropriate fitness model and its parameters. To this end, this research performs two experiment scenarios. The first scenario is to compare multi-level GA to single-level GA in solving the problem and to define the optimal parameters. We found that the multi-level GA obtains 108 minutes less trip duration. The second scenario is to evaluate the solution found by the multi-level GA. The trip duration is very close to the solution of brute force approach, with only 1 minute different, but with significantly faster processing time by 50 seconds compared to 20 minutes.

In this paper, the Double-Track Most Significant Operation First (DT-MSOF) strategy is proposed to improve system efficiency. In this strategy, the order of execution of the computing element according to their importance and the execution need only be done until the result is correct and/or acceptable. To know the performance of this strategy, two simulations are performed and an example of application is demonstrated. The simulation results show that the execution efficiency using DT-MSOF is better than DT-LSOF and DT-RSOF, measured by the percentage of executed computation. The demonstration indicates the possibility of implementation of this strategy on particular problem. A computing strategy called Double Track???Most Significant Operation First (DT-MSOF) is proposed. The goal of the strategy is to reduce computation time by reducing the number of operations that need to be executed, while maintaining a correct final result. Executions are conducted to a sequence of computing operations that were previously sorted based on significance. Computation will only run until the result meets the needs of the user. In this study, the DT-MSOF strategy was used to modify the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm into MD-AHP in order to reduce the number of operations that need to be done. The conventional AHP uses a run-to-completion approach, in which decisions can only be obtained after all of the operations have been completed. On the other hand, the calculations in MD-AHP are carried out iteratively only until the conditions are reached where a decision can be made. The simulation results show that MD-AHP can reduce the number of operations that need to be done to obtain the same results (decisions) as obtained by conventional AHP. It was also found that the more uneven the distribution of priority values, the more the number of operations could be reduced.","['operations', 'strategy', 'execution']"

Fluctuating commodity prices are causing anxiety among consumers, especially farmers. The price of these commodities, especially chilies, has become a major concern for the Indonesian government. Price changes occur due to several factors: product quality, market demand, and production costs. The quality of the product is determined by the growth process of the commodity. If selling price is influenced by product quality and product quality is influenced by weather, then there is an indirect correlation between price and weather. In this study, the selling price of chilies and tomatoes was predicted using a modified Artificial Neural Network algorithm, optimized by a Nested Genetic algorithm. The results were then classified to obtain economic price and planting recommendations. The price is said to be economic in value if the selling price is greater than the cost of production. Farmers can use planting recommendations to decide the right planting period, so that there is no harvest failure. In addition, using this information, farmers will not suffer from losses due to selling prices that cannot cover production costs.

In addition, the data center also requires redundant links, in order to avoid the occurrence of failure in the network. Applying topologies such as as fat-tree can solve the redundant link needs problem. However, the use of redundant links that are only used as backups are considered ineffective. A routing mechanism that can exploit the potential of existing links sufficiently is required. Equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) is a routing scheme that can be implemented to solve the problem. With the implementation of software defined network (SDN) on the network, the construction of this routing scheme will be more accessible. The ECMP scheme utilizes modified Dijkstra???s algorithm to search for the shortest path, and uses the modulo-n hashing method in the selection of the delivery path. This paper implements ECMP scheme on fat-tree topology with SDN-based network. The results obtained in this study prove that the network implementing ECMP can provide a throughput difference of 60.14Mbps when compared with static routing in a 20Mbps bandwidth traffic test scenario.

Faez Sharif,"Simulation and computational analysis of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol is done to evaluate their binding affinity against ER??. Active site prediction was done using Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of Proteins (CASTp) to determine the binding pocket of ER??. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were done to assess the binding affinity and stability of the ligand-ER?? complexes formed. Results showed that Tamoxifen have lowest binding energy (-9.61 ?? 0.39 kcal/mol) followed by 6-gingerol (-6.59 ?? 0.29 kcal/mol) and 6-shogaol (-5.70 ?? 0.36 kcal/mol). Inhibition constant (Ki) range of TMX-ER?? was found to be drastically lower than both 6GN-ER?? and 6SG-ER??. Based on the difference in the binding energy range and inhibition constant, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol showed less potential in substituting tamoxifen for the inhibition of ER??. Docking complexes formed was supported with stability in root mean square deviation (RMSD) and total binding energy of the complexes. The study is concluded that 6-gingerol have high level of interactions with the ER?? active site in terms of hydrogen bonding whereas hydrophobic interactions are observed with both 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol. However, both ginger bioactive compounds poses low potential as substitute in comparison with tamoxifen against ER??. Molecular docking was done to assess the binding affinity of 6-paradol (6PRD), Zingerone (ZGR) and Zerumbone (ZRB) ligand-ER?? complex in comparison to Hydroxytamoxifen (HTMX). Docking results showed that Glu353 and Arg394 active residues forms hydrogen bonding with 6PRD and ZGR. Glu353, Leu387 and Arg394 were the three identical residues found to formed hydrophobic interaction in HTMX-ER??, 6PRD-ER?? and ZGR-ER??. HTMX showed lowest binding energy (-10.71 ?? 0.43 kcal/mol) followed by ZRB (-8.66 ?? 0.04 kcal/mol), 6PRD (-6.92 ?? 0.14 kcal/mol) and ZGR (-5.93 ?? 0.31 kcal/mol). Inhibition constant (Ki) range of 6PRD-ER?? was found to be drastically lower than HTMX-ER??, ZGR-ER?? and ZRB-ER??. Based on the docking analysis, the three bioactive compounds were showed to poses low potential as substitute towards tamoxifen. Future study is recommended for analysing 6PRD potential in substituting estradiol as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for breast cancer.","['binding', '??', 'kcal/mol)']"

"HILAL HUDAN NUHA (NIP: 13860093-1, NIDN: 0402128603)","Seismic surveys produce large amount of data that is required to maintain the accuracy of the survey. However, this large data delays the processing since transmission of this data is time consuming. Compressing the data can accelerate the transmission time since the data size become smaller. We proposed to use Deep Machine Learning Network (DMLN) to compress the seismic data using dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality of data can be reduced using a small middle layer in DMLN. Such network is called Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) network. The DAE uses Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to obtain close to optimal initial weights. We decompose DAE into several RBMs and pre-train them layer by layer. RBM is a special case of Boltzmann Machine (BM) where there are no weights that connect units in the same layer. The network consists of visible and hidden layer with stochastic binary units for each layer, however, the bidirectional weights connecting visible and hidden layers are real values. The RBM has an energy function for each combination of units and weights. Using Contrastive Divergence (CD) and Gibbs sampling, initial weights that closed to the optimal can be obtained. Regular back-propagation with gradient descent is then used to fine-tune the weights of the pretrained networks. We used a set of 594 real seismic traces from East Texas dataset. The data is randomly divided into 400 traces for training, 100 traces for testing, and 94 traces for cross validation. Each trace consists of 1501 data points with 2 ms sampling period representing 3 seconds of trace recording. The 150 units in the middle layer lead to a compression ratio of 10:1. The RBM pre-training is set for 50 iterations. We compare the deep machine learning to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with the same number of hidden units. To assess the performance of the DAE, we used Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Peak SNR (PSNR) to quantify the quality of the reconstruction accuracies. The RBM pre-training requires 30 seconds, and the back-propagation training requires one hour to converge, on average. The training time of DAE is nine times faster than that of MLP. The experiments show that the DAE is able to reconstruct the testing data with average SNR and PSNR of 31dB and 37dB, respectively, while the traditional MLP reconstruct the data with only SNR and PSNR of 22dB and 29dB, respectively. In a geophysical exploration survey, thousands of geophones are deployed where each geophone must transmit hundreds of recording over a narrow band channel to a fusion center. A lightweight compression technique for geophones is required to reduce the data traf???c to the center. We present an ef???cient implementation of neural network for real-time seismic data compression for geophones. We use an auto-associative neural network architecture with a single linear hidden layer. The neural network is trained in two stages. First, we apply unsupervised learning with restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to obtain good initial weights. Secondly, the neural network with the initial weights is further ???ne-tuned in a supervised fashion with scaled conjugate gradient (SCG). Experimental results with real data have shown that the trained neural network achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of more than 30dB with a compression ratio of 10:1. The RBM is also proven to speed up the training up to nine times than that of withoutRBM.Theproposedmethodisalsocomparedwiththe linear predictive coding (LPC) and shows signi???cant superiority in terms of compression error and reconstruction quality. In this work, an analysis of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Congestion Window with traffic model of twitter using exponential distribution is presented. TCP is a popular reliable protocol used by many internet service. As social media emerge and introduce new characteristic of traffic, it is interesting to evaluate the performance of TCP in the latest social media environment scenario. Twitter as top social media shows its influence by taking part of many political event in the globe. An exponential distribution traffic model of Twitter traffic is proposed and an experiment on evaluation of TCP congestion window is presented in this paper. Congestion window represents efficiency of TCP to adapt network condition since the metric shows the number of data transmitted in a single transmission. In stable condition, shared bandwidth carry out higher congestion window which makes transmission more efficient. Combination of high traffic flow and high bandwidth comes with lower congestion window variation with 0.58 where low traffic flow obtains higher variance with 1.15.","['data', 'network', 'weights']"
HUSNA AYDADENTA (2301160016),"Microarray data plays an essential role in diagnosing and detecting cancer. Microarray analysis allows the examination of levels of gene expression in specific cell samples, where thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously. However, microarray data have very little sample data and high data dimensionality. Therefore, to classify microarray data, a dimensional reduction process is required. Dimensional reduction can eliminate redundancy of data; thus, features used in classification are features that only have a high correlation with their class. There are two types of dimensional reduction, namely feature selection and feature extraction. In this paper, we used k-means algorithm as the clustering approach for feature selection. The proposed approach can be used to categorize features that have the same characteristics in one cluster, so that redundancy in microarray data is removed. The result of clustering is ranked using the Relief algorithm such that the best scoring element for each cluster is obtained. All best elements of each cluster are selected and used as features in the classification process. Next, the Random Forest algorithm is used. Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the proposed approach for each dataset, namely Colon, Lung Cancer, and Prostate Tumor, achieved 85.87 , 98.9 , and 89 accuracy, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed approach is therefore higher than the approach using Random Forest without clustering.","['microarray', 'data', 'used']"

I PUTU ADHI SUWANDIKA (1103134398),"This paper proposes load balancing scheme for improving SDN network performance on web server application. The use of load balancing on web servers over SDN networks is interesting problem to enhance. One of the problems is determining the suitable algorithm for web server which has bound function (session). Load balancing algorithm that provide stable performance is a static algorithm. However, this algorithm does not have a function bound to a server, so it is not possible to apply to a web server with bound functions, such as login session function. This paper uses Hash and Least Connection IP algorithm to overcome this problem. We have proved the enhancement of load balancing performance using Least Connection and IP Hash algorithm with three parameters such as response time, throughput and resource utilization. The result shows that IP Hash algorithm gives performance response time 17 more optimal, 10 more optimal throughput and 8 usage memory more efficient than Least Connection algorithm.","['algorithm', 'load', 'balancing']"

Hence, PTP1B has become the primary target of drug development to treat this disease. In this study, we aim to develop QSAR model to predict PTP1B inhibitor by using a neural network method. Genetic algorithm (GA) method was used to select the set of the molecular descriptor. We improved the performance of the models by performing a hyperparameter tuning procedure. From the results of validation analysis, we found that the model 2 containing 5 descriptors as the best model. This confirms by the value of MCC (0.68) and AUC (0.89) of this model that is higher than the others. Also, the additional y-scrambled analysis confirms that this model does not correspond to coincidental correlation, indicated by a very low value of MCC of the scrambled model. Iron-sulfur proteins are essential in several biological processes, such as electron transfers in photosystems and respiratory chains. The range of redox potentials of these proteins are so wide that many substrates can interact with them. Thus, the redox potentials of the iron-sulfur proteins are crucial to facilitate the process. This study aims to investigate the redox potential of iron-sulfur proteins with [2Fe-2S] core by using two typical exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory (DFT), i.e., B3LYP and M06, with and without the diffuse function. Since it involves transition metals, several types of spin approximation were also explored, such as high spin (HS), low spin (LS), approximated spin projection (AP), and J coupling parameter (JC) methods. We found that the diffuse function contributes to improving the accuracy. We also found that M06 functional produced more accurate results than B3LYP. The best result is obtained for AP UM06/ 6-31++G(d,p) with the absolute error of 0.01 V. We investigated the effect of an axial ligand on the electronic properties of type I copper (T1Cu) protein. Several density functional theory (DFT) functionals were utilized, including pure generalized gradient approximation, hybrid DFT, and long- range corrected (LC) DFT.

The factors are based on Triple-Factor Approach as the reference in generating personalized learning. This research performs two-level clustering analysis to acquire learning patterns from activity logs from Moodle Learning Management System using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and k-Means. SOM enables visualization high dimensional data by projection to lower dimensions. The proto-clusters of SOM are then clustered using k-Means. The temporal clustering results show that the learning patterns of learners are changing over time. Different needs and characteristics among e-learning users have become the main reasons behind the emerging research on e-learning personalization. One the one hand, personalization needs to determine the learning type of learner. On the other hand, learning type changes over time. This research explores the alteration of learning type using temporal data analysis. This research adapts the Triple-Factor Approach that includes learning styles, motivation, and knowledge ability in determining learning type. The objective of the current research is to explore how the different ways and a different time in capturing activity log can affect the learning type identification. The activity logs were provided by Moodle. To provide the temporal data, the activity log data were collected on four different times. On each period, the data were captured both cumulatively and non-cumulatively. The results indicated that the learning types of the learners were very likely to change from time to time. The temporal data analysis showed that the way the learners learnt, their learning motivation, and learners??? knowledge level were dynamic. The intensity of one's activities at the end of the semester could be different compared to the activities in the early week. It also occurred to motivation and the level of knowledge.","['learning', 'type', 'system']"
Karzan Wakil,"Abstract: Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) became to standard of interactive web applications on the internet fastly. It is a complex application with a rich user interface that distributed the data between client and server also allowing an asynchronous communication between them, but web engineering methods are not able to design and implement these features impeccably. The recent web engineering method is Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML) which adopted by Object Management Group (OMG). It has many features for developing interactions in web application compared with other web engineering methods but also has limitation for designing RIA features. In this paper, we enhance IFML method through extension the metamodels by using UML extension mechanism, in which, we define new IFML metamodel and some new elements to cope RIA features designing in data distribution between client and server. The results show that this enhancement enables IFML to develop the new types of web applications efficiently.

Kashif Hussain,"Real-life optimization problems demand robust algorithms that perform efficient search in the environment without trapping in local optimal locations. Such algorithms are equipped with balanced explorative and exploitative capabilities. Cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is also one of such optimization algorithms, which is inspired from nature. Despite effective search strategies using L??vy flights and solution switching approach, CS suffers from lack of population diversity when implemented in hard optimization problems. In this paper, enhanced local and global search strategies have been proposed in CS algorithm. The proposed variant employs personal best information in solution generation process, hence called Personal Best Cuckoo Search (pBestCS). Moreover, instead of constant value for switching parameter, pBestCS dynamically updates switching parameter as the iterations proceed. The prior approach enhances local search ability, whereas the later modification enforces effective global search ability in the algorithm. The experimental results on both unimodal and multimodal test functions with different dimensionalities validated the efficiency of the proposed modification. Based on comprehensive statistical analysis and comparisons, pBestCS outperformed the standard CS algorithm, as well as, other popular swarm-based metaheuristic algorithms particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC).","['search', 'optimization', 'algorithms']"
Kauthar Mohd Daud,"Multiobjective optimization requires of finding a trade-off between multiple objectives. However, most of the objectives are contradict towards each other, thus makes it difficult for the traditional approaches to find a solution that satisfies all objectives. Fortunately, the problems are able to solve by the aid of Pareto methods. Meanwhile, in in silico Metabolic Engineering, the identification of reaction knockout strategies that produce mutant strains with a permissible growth rate and product rate of desired metabolites is still hindered. Previously, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) has been successfully used in determining the reaction knockout strategies. Nevertheless, most methods work by optimizing one objective function, which is growth rate or production rate. Furthermore, in bioprocesses, it involves multiple and conflicting objectives. In this review, we aim to show the different multiobjective evolutionary optimization methods developed for tackling the multiple and conflicting objectives in in silico metabolic engineering, as well as the approaches in multiobjective optimization.

Kommineni Jenni,"The Emotional Face Recognition (EFR) is strengthening the security measures where Biometric authentication is adopted for surveillance system. The integration of facial features with biometric authentications is unable to recognize appropriate facial components due to its dynamic gesture. The emotional face recognition techniques will identify dynamic gestures and to identify the appropriate facial component which increase the efficiency of biometric authentication. The facial feature vector is generated from the formation of geometrical objects using identified facial focal points. This paper analyse the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Central moment, Face boundary extraction using Connected Component Analysis (CCA) approaches to identify the focal points. The integrated approach is derived from the analysis to identify significant facial focal points to construct the knowledge base. The knowledge base construction process includes selection of Region of Interest (ROI), determination of facial blocks, fixation and representation of facial focal points. It leads to develop a procedure for significant facial feature vector edges formation from the extracted facial focal points, which represented in the knowledge base. This procedure produces the partial and mesh structure from the captured emotional faces. In human communication, facial expressions play an important role, which carries enough information about human emotions. It becomes a very active research area in pattern recognition and computer vision. In this type of recognition there is a drawback of how extend the features are extracted from the facial images and to predict the level of difficulties in the extraction of the facial expressions. To propose an efficient approach for emotion or facial expression analysis and recognition with the help of the facial expression database images. In this paper, an efficient approach for emotion or facial expression analysis based on Dual Tree M-Band Wavelet Transform (DTMBWT) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is presented. Different facial expressions are represented by DTMBWT at various decomposition levels from 1 to 6. From the representations, DTMBWT energy and entropy features are extracted as features for the corresponding facial expression. These features are analyzed for the recognition using GMM classifier by varying the number of Gaussians used. Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) database which contains 7 facial expressions; happy, sad, angry, fear, neutral, surprise, and disgust is employed for the evaluation.

Lia Yuliawati,"The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is known as a unidirectional wave equation that can represent effects of weakly dispersive as well as weakly nonlinear, and it has an analytical solution. In this paper, we consider a KdV equation from a variational approach, where the equation has a Hamiltonian structure. Here, we present an alternative way to find soliton solutions of the KdV equation with a Hamiltonian structure. The soliton solutions of the KdV equation can be found iteratively by solving a problem of maximization of the Hamiltonian in a level set of the corresponding momentum of the KdV. The constrained maximization problem is then solved by using conjugate gradient method iteratively. We show that arbitrary initial guesses for the conjugate gradient method converge iteratively to unique analytical soliton solutions of the KdV equation relating to the momentum. Moreover, to check the propagation of the resulting soliton solutions, we propagate the solitons using a pseudo-spectral implementation of the KdV equation. The simulations show the undisturbed propagation of the solitons. In addition, some simulations are performed to show the relationship between parameters in the constrained Hamiltonian maximization problem with their corresponding soliton profiles.","['equation', 'kdv', 'soliton']"

However, recognizing details about object???s attributes can be more informative and also helpful for a better scene understanding in intelligent vehicle uses. This paper introduces a method for simultaneous semantic segmentation and pedestrian attributes recognition. A modified dataset built on top of the Cityscapes dataset is created by adding attribute classes corresponding to pedestrian orientation attributes. The proposed method extends the SegNet model and is trained by using both the original and the attribute-enriched datasets. Based on an experiment, the proposed attribute-aware semantic segmentation approach shows the ability to slightly improve the performance on the Cityscapes dataset, which is capable of expanding its classes in this case through additional data training. Semantic segmentation is widely developed in many researches for various purposes. In recent years, several studies have been conducted using various approaches for better classifying a number of distinct objects. Furthermore, semantic information is beneficial for segmentation and segmentation results help more in recognizing semantics. However, only class of each region is considered as the semantic information in traditional semantic segmentation methods. We consider attributes of objects as such additional information. For instance, since the silhouette of a pedestrian is strongly related to the pedestrian's facing orientation, it can help orientation recognition of the pedestrian. We are aiming to collaborate between semantic segmentation and attribute recognition for better results in scene understanding. As the first step, we utilize semantic segmentation results for pedestrian orientation recognition.","['semantic', 'segmentation', 'pedestrian']"

"MIRA KANIA SABARIAH (NIP: 14770011-1, NIDN: 0418027701)","Interactive learning media for children is currently essential because of the rapid development of digital technology. One of the challenges in building interactive media for children's learning is how to present the application by the needs and growth of the child's age. The involvement of children in the process of elicitation requirements is a difficult thing to do. This is due to the limitations of the child in communicating when conveying his wishes and the ability of the limited elicitation team. Persona is widely used by software developers when determining user needs and behavior. Persona is an effective way for developers, especially the elicitation team in conducting the requirements elicitation process. Defining the persona variable is a part that needs to be considered especially in identifying the age stages of child development. Pedagogical aspects also need to be explored through the persona variable. Education and social-emotional are persona variables that can help the elicitation team to present aspects of pedagogy. The output from the persona also helps the elicitation team to build the prototypes and forms of instruments used when communicating with children when the elicitation process is carried out. Requirements elicitation are the initial stages in requirements engineering and are crucial stages. Failure in the steps of requirements elicitation can lead to a lack of definition of user needs for the application so that it has an impact on the quality and usability of the software produced. That will also affect the application of children's education, where without involving children in the elicitation process, it can make the software built not by the age development needs of the child. Failure in requirements elicitation occurs because of lack of knowledge of analysts in communicating and choosing elicitation techniques. Both components have a close relationship with the type of users who will become respondents. Nowadays, requirements elicitation framework tends to pay more attention to adults and parents, while for children it is still not found. Children have different characteristics with adults and parents, so it needs to be considered in carrying out approaches or techniques in performing elicitation. The selection of elicitation techniques that are not by the characteristics of children can cause failure in exploring the needs of children for child learning applications built. Based on these problems, we need a requirements elicitation framework in children's education applications. The requirements for the elicitation framework are expected to make it easier for child learning application developers to get application requirements that are appropriate for the child's developmental age. Children's educational applications are designed to help children in the learning process; thus, direct child involvement in elicitation process helps to achieve learning objectives. Failure in the requirements elicitation stage may lead to undefined user requirements for the application affecting the quality and usability of the developed software. Failure in requirements elicitation occurs because the user is not directly involved in the application. It is also caused by the lack of the elicitation team's knowledge in selecting elicitation techniques that match the characteristics of users, where children have different characteristics with adults and parents. Communication in exploring the needs of users is closely related to elicitation techniques selection. Selection of elicitation techniques that are inconsistent with children's characteristics can lead to failure in exploring the children's needs for children educational application. The results of questionnaires and interview with the application developers show that the prototype and interview techniques are the techniques most suitable in the elicitation process involving children as respondents because these methods are suitable for the child characteristics and the short elicitation time required in the application development.","['elicitation', 'requirements', 'children']"

MUCHAMMAD FERDIAN AKBAR (1103130293),"This paper proposes smart light recommending system based on monitoring data using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. lights are one of the biggest contributors to the power consumption of electrical equipment. The effort to reduce the use of lights is related to not using them when they are not in use. One of the moments when the lights are not used is when we are ing but some user styles keep the lights on even when they are ing so the idea is how to turn off the lights after the user s. To realize this idea, it is necessary to detect which can be derived from the detection of heart rate by certain sensors. The sensors that are needed are those already embedded in Fitbit, a bracelet-shaped device that can detect various kinds of conditions in the human body. However, Fitbit cannot directly provide the condition to the user or the lamp, but it can provide information in the form of logs, so that the lamp settings cannot be instantaneous. To overcome this problem a learning method can be applied to know patterns that appear in logs produced by Fitbit. This paper applies ANN back propagation to learn the patterns of users, especially start time and end time. Nine ANN models made from user data are applied to 60 days of testing. From these models, the best results were given by the model which gave 82.27 accuracy for start time and 98.28 for end time. Accuracy is largely determined by the user's style.","['lights', 'user', 'time']"

Turning off all app processes behind the screen can be a solution. However, it can disturb the user if the certain app process which is needed by the user is also terminated. Therefore, a special mechanism is required to regulate the processes which run such as by using the app categories which are associated with the user preference. When the selected categories are chosen, then the priority of the applications' importance is carried out. So that it can be known that whether the process is important or not for the user to be turned off. The built system model has been tested for the power usage assessment by using Ampere meter.

One of the problems at the intersection, particularly involving the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is to reduce the utilization of BRT lanes by non-BRT vehicles. This paper proposes a formal model of traffic control system for intersection with contraflow lanes for BRT. Based on the traffic regulations and pertinent data concerning typical intersection and contraflow lanes, we design a generic four-armed junction with specialized contraflow lanes for BRT. By using LTL formulas that describe a general traffic scenario and informal traffic specifications to check the compliance of our model, we demonstrate that our proposed formal model complies to the traffic regulations and specifications. In this paper we study the security aspect of Megrelishvili protocol???a linear algebra-based variant of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. We demonstrate that the conventional version of this protocol is vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack. Hence, to avert such attack, we propose an authenticated version of this protocol using an embedded digital signature scheme. The scheme is constructed using the hardness assumption of the Megrelishvili vector-matrix problem (MVMP)???the underlying computational problem for the security of the conventional Megrelishvili protocol.

It is also more ontology-based, due to their efficiency, scalability, lack of constraints and the availability of large ontologies. However, ontology-based semantic similarity is hampered by the fact that it depends on the overall scope and detail of the background ontology. This leads to insufficient knowledge, missing terms and inaccuracy. This limitation can be overcome by exploiting multiple ontologies. Semantic similarity with multiple ontologies potentially leads to better accuracy because it is able to calculate the similarity of these missing terms from the combination of multiple knowledge sources. This research aims to develop and evaluate a feature-based mechanism (Hyb-TvX) to measure semantic similarity with multiple ontologies which can improve the accuracy of the similarity. Similarity value, correlation and p-value were also used in the evaluation of the relationship between the concept pair of multiple ontologies. Besides that, the Hyb-TvX mechanism produces the highest correlation value compared to the other two methods, that is 0.759 and the result correlation is significant.","['similarity', 'ontologies', 'multiple']"

Backwater is an increase of the upstream water level resulting from an obstruction of the flow, here is caused by the installation of a sluice gate. In addition, characteristic of the upstream and downstream flow which depend on flow types (subcritical or supercritical) must also be examined. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of steady river flow through a sluice gate. On a river flow, the presence of a sluice gate (with a fixed opening), will change the total energy of the flow. Then, using the specific energy curve we can determine water surface level behind the gate. Further, by implementing the standard step method, a steady water surface on the upstream part of the gate can be calculated. This surface forms a backwater flow that extends far enough behind the gate. Characteristic of this backwater flow depends crucially on the flow discharge and the opening of the sluice gate.

User experience (UX) is the outcome that this study wants to achieve through implementing user centred design in the process by defining the set of methods and phases, which have loosely connected each other to solve the problem arisen. This study identified the lack of integration process within driving communities to improve the service of motorcycle driving practice, permission letter and rental. Education has purposes to improve quality of human resources and to develop readiness to look at future. It also play critical role to reduce ignorance, recognize the potency and shape the behavior in the community. There are two types well-know of education in Indonesia, which are formal (kindergarten, elementary, junior high, senior high and university) and non-formal (computer courses, English lessons, tutoring session, vocational training and professional certification). Of course, people will go to formal education to obtain graduation degree for the necessity of finding job and position in the market. But, some people tend to seek alternative to provide adequate education for their future. It hinted certain problems have been resided in the current educational model, which focus on face to face approach. Along with the rising of IT in the era of Industry 4.0 in every aspect of daily life, people learn mostly every subject through Internet without considering much on its credibility. Thus, this paper explore the possibility of using hybrid method, which is known for blended learning to be implemented in nonformal education to help facilitate the public on information availability and develop mastery-based presentation to improve the understanding of student efficiently. This study proposes portal website to provide digital gift as the attempt to develop radical innovation by offering interactive and dynamic interaction between customer and community.

There is great potential in the Zakat Management System (ZMS) to increase social welfare requires government attention. By using the appropriate technological advances to administer zakat process might improve the efficien-cy to optimize the potential. Therefore, several related factors must be consid-ered such as human, environment, culture, language, literacy and regulation to improve the effectiveness of interaction and communication among stakehold-ers. This study discusses several journals and articles that focus on various problems faced by zakat institution in 5 (five) stages namely planning, collect-ing, organizing, distributing and disbursing in Indonesia and other Muslim countries for references. The design for interaction can provide more views of the system weaknesses to improve decision making process by generating the correct strategy to produce an efficient process. User engagement can be defined as the perception of the user to qualify the experience towards certain application, which focus on the positive aspects of the interaction through Internet in the context of the desire to use it continuously and for longer time. It is fundamental concept in the design of online applications regardless of the platform, driven by the observation that successful applications are not only used but those that work. However, user engagement in the technology advancement is a paradox phenomenon, as they recognize the potentiality but reluctant to adopt or they realize its use to solve problem but prefer the other solution for longer of time. The usual ways to evaluate them can be through self-report measures, observational methods, speech analysis or web analytics. These methods represent different compensations in term of configuration, the size of object and the scale of data to be collected. For example, some study might find detail and deep analysis but they are limited in term of generalizability, while the other might found out resourceful but denies the user reasoning and the context. During this millennial, the diffusion of innovation became the acceptable theory that majority academician and practical expert use to explain the phenomenon of the reason and factor to adopt certain product. Therefore, due to the assumption of several factors such as technology advancement and paradigm shift, this study want to explore current situation in the user engagement factors, which focused to computer mediated communication. The parking process is common attempt to eliminate traffic in the road by providing certain spot for vehicle to stay for certain time. Considering the increase of amount of population, large parking area horizontally or vertically is not necessary proper solution because it requires enormous expenses to acquire vacant land or to construct high-rise building. Therefore, smart parking system is one solution to provide information on the availability of vacant parking locations efficiently and conduct identification and transaction process quickly. Telkom University has been adopted this system by using physical card with RFID built-in for handling, convenience and security purposes since October 2014. Even though, it deliver an easy way for verification and validation but some problem occurred that raise several complaints from student and staff. This study has objective to explore the challenges and to addresses the issues faced by smart parking system, which has been implemented in subsequent years. By identifying the solution, it can improve the quality of the system for greater purpose in the future. The adoption of e-voting in various countries raises some challenges, which are very similar when electronic means are applied to any activities, such as e-governance or e-commerce. Still, some people due to economics, politics or social reasons expect the e-voting use will facilitate and solve previous election???s problem. Unfortunately, the most complex and difficult practical implementation with distinct problems depends on the particular condition or culture. One of essential factor concerning the adoption related to privacy protection. Thus, this study examines the relationship of certain factors namely technology solution, social norm and legal regulation by establishing model of formative measurement. For the generalization purposes, a survey questionnaire consists of 4 categories of 45 items was distributed offline and online to approximately 800 people with purposive sampling in selected multicultural cities in Indonesia. This study investigates the legality of practitioners in interpreting UU PP (Electoral Act) to provide guidance in technical and managerial aspect especially in relation with principle of privacy by applying content analysis. This act explain 12 principles namely independence, honest, fair, legal certainty, orderly, public interest, openness, proportionality, professionalism, accountability, effectiveness and efficiency. Based on Act No. 15/2011, there are three main election organizer, which are general election committee (KPU), election supervisory bodies (Bawaslu) and honorary council of election organizer (DKPP). Interestingly, Parliament have been enacted new legislation in the form of Act No. 7/2017, which has many controversies around it such as presidential threshold, parliamentary threshold, magnitude of electoral districts, ambiguity of requirements, vote conversion and openness system. Still, the analysis of previous electoral act that keep changes ahead of the election can give a good picture of its role and importance. Thus, this study design code paper to be distributed to 21 coders to gain more understanding the approach which is appropriate to synergize various interest in election to bring more appropriate management to align with voters expectation especially in regard to privacy policy. This study explores the problems and challenges faced by several universities in Indonesia to allow, commonly, the first year students to enroll in dormitory either online or offline. It is reasonable for prospective students to have expectation that university provide suitable facilities in term of accommodation and logistics considering that a large number of student come from different cities in various provinces. The development of Dormitory Residential Management System (DRMS) should accommodate the process of enrollment, payment and booking from student online and support the staff to control and manage integrated program or activities based on determined schedule. Besides that, the system also allow monitoring process for reporting purpose and notify or confirm certain activities or allocation process. This study investigates several systems used by respected universities to identify the level of satisfaction of students. Interestingly, there are many evidences showed bottom level of satisfaction from student towards the services offered by university for DRMS. nformation Public Disclosure is one of the regulation that has purposes to encourage good governance for public service and citizen participation in national development. The enactment of Act No.14/2008 (UU KIP) has been strengthen the mandate to enforce the necessity of information disclosure in actualizing transparency and accountability in resource management and budget uses. It also become the primary instrument to prevent corruption, monopolistic competition and information disputes. However, there are certain provinces has not yet established information committee nor when it will be as entrusted by the regulation. Meanwhile, the remedies in term of jail duration and fines, arguably, it could not create deterrent effect to the perpetrator. Furthermore, the concern from ministry and public institution also in question in regard their roles of responsibility, lack of cooperation and continuous support. Thus, human resource, technology infrastructure, public participation, supervision and socialization become crucial factor to increase the awareness and satisfaction towards this regulatory compliance. This study is a qualitative research to evaluate the implementation of this Act by observing its consideration, background, principles and relevant article verses as primary sources through content analysis based on number of legal experts. Understanding of behaviour can be evaluated either by public decision-makers, who have been the main concern of political scientists or by voters, who have participated directly in the process of election. Therefore, this study focused on the voters??? self-evaluation to see behaviour about voter decisions by survey questionnaire, which factors such as gender, race, culture or conflict play a very important role. In addition, major influences to the public also involves the role of emotion, political socialization and tolerance to the diversity of media views. This study investigated gender-based patterns of 790 samples using PLS as a data analysis tool, which found interesting result of three variables depict the characteristics of voters. Today, IT services are obtained with a combination of multiple type of work activities, primarily through sub-contract or known for as outsourcing policy. Structured activities are mainly based on standard processes, procedures and tools while unstructured mostly related to obtain new experience or knowledge in the different field through supervision. In support and delivery IT service, increasingly popular standardization efforts to be implemented into the business process which advocate for diverse kind of management such as capability, capacity, availability, service-level and financial in order to attain best level of IT product and quality result. As IT departments or division plan to bridge the digital divide that become the current trend, it is important that the automation can empower the process to become more efficient, there should be the trade-off to gain some improved activities if not have intention to hold the advantages as a adaptive, trigger and catalyst due to the interdependency. Thus, this study wants to develop an application in regard to deliver outsourcing service in various classification or type by understanding the current issue in the outsourcing in relation to pros and cons to balance the demand from the corporation (client) and preferences from the worker (provider). Privacy is the capability of individuals or groups to isolate the information about themselves from the eyes of everybody partially or physically, then express themselves selectively. Therefore, there are differences in term of content or boundaries among culture and society on what is considered private but share common themes. In the Internet, privacy is the broad term to explain a diverse of antecedents, factors, predictors and mechanism to secure and protect confidential, sensitive or secret data in the communication channel based on selected preferences. Thus, this study will explore the concept of privacy in the following decades by collecting all empirical evidence that match with eligible criteria to deliver meticulous summary in the response to a research question, which are related to the drivers of privacy protection. Responsive Innovation can be define as the attempt from the corporate or respected individual to bring the solution from particular problem by offer more ideal practical implementation based on specific requirement in the market. This type innovation can be generated or effectuate through modifying, combining, substituting or eliminating current process of problem solving or decision making in the market to be more precise, efficient and rigid compare to the previous. This study explore the possibilities to identify the characteristics of responsive innovation by developing web and mobile application based on the demand in the market with the several criteria namely number of exist application, higher demand, user experience attachment, attractive market and small routine margin of profit. Thus, this study present the application design called eLo and FunBuz to make it easier the process of order or reservation online. Employee in the organization or customer from company can significantly affect the overall strength of security of the system as the human factor become the common problem that lead to damage or disaster. Unfortunately, most security solutions offered in the market do not consider user as a critical security element. In this study, it is proposed to evaluate the awareness of the user regarding information security problems from three type of antecedents, which are individual, institutional and environmental. In order to collect data, questionnaires have been sent to the users using systematic sampling based on the domain of pattern concern on the role of responsibility. The cluster analysis method was applied to sample of users in categories related to the various items represented in the type of antecedents. It has objective to place a set of object in such a way that have tendency to be similar to each other in one group and tend to be differ in the opposite group. Then, the development of SADAR emphasized four groups namely define, devote, discover and direct. Common problems in service delivery is might related to the issue of timing, marketing cost, user experience, generating lead, identifying prospect, forecasting demand, value proposition, security, privacy, identity management and many more. Unfortunately, company often decided on the wrong context and concept lead to misrepresentation and misinterpretation on the requirement for the service improvement. Thus, the direct intervention through certain criteria in the characteristics and attribute of service delivery should be conducted with judgment assessment. It is done in order to identify the target and examine the policy used to support the outcomes. Thus, this study explore the model used for particular company, which in this case NetHost to provide insights on how the assessment can be fruitful in the long term investment for intangible aspects of service delivery. Student-centred learning has been defined as small approach to improve learning objective through variety of process where students not only choose what to learn, but how and why. Moreover, the essence of the learning environment is the responsibility and activities of students, in contrast to the focus on coach control and the scope of academic content in the teaching with the traditional teaching. In this case, the use of Team based learning can take into account the aspects of the time of tasks termination and student activities to learn the subject content in the maximum way to enrich the other concepts outside the learning module. This study investigate the utilization of Team Based Learning in the subject of Interaction Design to improve the understanding from the student towards the curriculum objective and target. The efficiency of network administrators from network management decreases because networks become more complex and heterogeneous.

Mohammed Ahmed Jubair,"Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-sufficient networks that can work without the need for centralized controls, pre-configuration to the routes or advance infrastructures. The nodes of a MANET are autonomously controlled, which allow them to act freely in a random manner within the MANET. The nodes can leave their MANET and join other MANETs at any time. These characteristics, however, might negatively affect the performance of the routing protocols and the overall topology of the networks. Subsequently, MANETs comprise specially designed routing protocols that reactively and/or proactively perform the routing. This paper evaluates and compares the performance of two routing protocols which are Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) in MANET environment. The study includes implementing a simulation to examine the performance of the routing protocols based on the variables of the nodes??? number and network size. The evaluation results show that the AODV outperforms the OLSR in most of the simulated cases. The results further show that the number of nodes and network size have a great impact on the Throughput (TH), Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and End-to-End delay (E2E) of the network.","['routing', 'manet', 'protocols']"
Mohd Amin Mohd Yunus,"This paper presents semantic approach on spoken word(s) for improving speech disorder in adults so that speech recognition tool detects the closed meanings of the speech disorder. Speech disorder occurs if the adults cannot pronounce the words clearly. Thus, semantic approach may disambiguate speech disorder so that the right word may be displayed where the meaning of the speech disorder is understood. We conducted the experiments that five adults??? people pronounced one sentence for three times in Arabic, Malay or English and the tool had explained the closed meaning or of the spoken words. The result from the speech recognition tool shows average of Recall Percentage, 77.77 and 74.15 in K and Q respectively of all participants with speech disorder are detected and improved with the semantic technique. . The findings from analysis explains the semantic technique in language dictionary of the speech recognition tool is very significant to make clear the meaning of the speech disorder in adults people and to help the listeners can understand their speeches on the tool???s screen. In addition, the listeners can understand also from translation of the meaning of speeches in Arabic, English and Malay. The tool also recalls in percentage the Quranic verses and chapter as part of understanding the Muslims Holy Book from the spoken sentences or queries. Documents translations are still ambiguous when we translate them using by word, by phrase or by context technically separately and based on different readers??? understandings. This paper proposes the Indexed References for retrieving the target translated documents based on the structure index of each document (text file) .Thus, Quran documents are translated easier based on unique structure index of each documents either indexing each Surah (Chapters) or indexing each Ayah (Verses) plus Surah as a unique reference. The documents translations retrieval based on Indexed Reference technique is more accurate at 99.99 comparing to the experimental separation of by word, by phrase and by concept translation technique. The proposed technique is useful for documents-to- documents translation retrieval in all languages of world.","['speech', 'disorder', 'documents']"
Mohd Hishamuddin Abdul Rahman,"Today, 3-dimensional (3-D) virtual worlds are exploited for online and virtual learning. Unlike the common online learning platforms, a virtual world environment closely resembles a 3-D video games environment. Thus the age of students might affect their sense of presence, interaction, and satisfaction in the said environment. Hence this study was conducted to investigate whether there are differences between students of different age groups on their sense of presence (place presence, social presence, and co-presence) and their learning satisfaction. The study was carried out for six weeks and involved 33 part-time diploma students with the use of interview and questionnaires as instruments. The results indicated significant differences between young and senior students in terms of place presence, co-presence, and learning satisfaction, but no differences were identified for social presence.

Muhammad Aminu Umar,"ISO 9126 software quality model of 2001 is the most comprehensive and widely accepted model. It is a generic quality model that is used in measuring quality of software across computing domains. This study seeks to access the level of application of ISO 9126 model in measuring software quality and its impact on different software domains. We employed a standard methodology for systematic literature review using automated search on four digital libraries for studies published between 2001 and 2016. The results of the systematic review reveal that the model as a whole has played a significant role in measuring software quality across different domains. Out of total 63 primary studies, 30 applied the six characteristics, and 33 papers applied one or more characteristics for measuring software quality. Software component and database are the most evaluated domains, while usability characteristics are the most measured quality. This is the result of the fact that software vendors are moving towards quality user-centred design instead of technology driven designs. Ambiguity resulting from the lack of clear guideline and operational instrument for evaluation is the major shortcoming of this quality model, but were favored by many due to its flexibility to suit the growing software domains.","['software', 'quality', 'model']"
Muhammad Anwar,"Abstract: Advances in wireless communication technologies invented body sensor networks (BSNs) for health care systems. BSN monitors patients??? health remotely and automatically. It is economical and helpful solution for both patients and healthcare providers. BSN is made up of small Bio-medical sensors (BMSs) and Body Coordinator (BC). BMSs sense and transmit data continuously. As BSN consist of many BMSs, the simultaneous data transmission results in congestion in the network. Congestion causes packet drops which attempt to be retransmitted again and again. Therefore, the BMSs drain their energy fast and consequently reduce the network lifetime. In this work, a congestion avoidance and mitigation protocol (CAMP) is proposed for BSNs. The experimental results shows that the proposed protocol carried out better results in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime in BSNs.","['bsn', 'results', 'congestion']"

Mustafa Hamid Hassan,"A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) exhibits a dynamic topology with flexible infrastructure. The MANET nodes may serve as both host and router functionalities. The routing feature of the MANET is a stand-alone multi-hop mobile network that can be utilized in many real-time applications. Therefore, identifying paths that ensure high Quality of Service (QoS), such as their topology and applications is a vital issue in MANET. A QoS-aware protocol in MANETs aims to find more efficient paths between the source and destination nodes of the network and, hence, the requirements of the QoS. This paper proposes a new hybrid algorithm that combines Cellular Automata (CA) with the African Buffalo Optimization (ABO), CAABO, to improve the QoS of MANETs. The CAABO optimizes the path selection in the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. The test results show that with the aid of the CAABO, the AODV manifests energy and delay-aware routing protocol.","['network', 'manet', 'routing']"

NIA NOVITASARI (2201160006),"??? Bullwhip effect is the most feared phenomenon by the majority of companies because it leads to high operating costs. Bullwhip will also grow along with the increase in network tier or echelon of a distribution system. Bullwhip will become more severe when distributed products are fragile food products and have uncertain lead times and demand. In the systematic literature of this review, we will review the previous research on how to minimize the occurrence of the bullwhip effect. We also compared the differences and similarity models between common bullwhip mitigating models with bullwhip mitigating models for perishable products that have short life cycles. In further research, we will create optimal model to mitigate bullwhip, integrate the use of SCOR Framework to assess supply chain performance in food companies to minimize bullwhip effect. By using SCOR framework, we will be able to know the supply chain structure that is priority to be improved so that bullwhip on perishable product will decrease. Bullwhip effect in the supply chain distribution network is a phenomenon that is highly avoided because it can lead to high operational costs. It drew the attention of researchers to examine ways to minimize the bullwhip effect. Bullwhip effect occurs because of incorrect company planning in pursuit of customer demand. Bullwhip effect occurs due to increased amplitude of demand variance towards upper supply chain level. If the product handled is a perishable product it will make the bullwhip effect more sensitive. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to map out some of the variables used in constructing mathematical models to minimize the bullwhip effect on food supply chains that have perishable product characteristics. The result of this systematic literature review is that the authors propose an appropriate optimization model that will be applied in the food supply chain sales on the train in Indonesian railways in the next research. Abstract??? The inventory system has a function as an act of planning, implementing, controlling the flow and storage of a product and information effectively and efficiently in order to fulfill customer demand. However, there are differences between inventory system policies on non-perishable products and perishable products. In the perishable product, special handling is needed in storage by considering the shelf life and storage time to prevent damage or decay. Accuracy in designing inventories is a suitable solution to reduce the occurrence of expired products and unfulfilled customer demand due to a lost sale. The case study used was in food sales activities on the train. Products sold consist of two categories: fresh food (8 hours) and frozen food (30 days). Travel time for each train is between 8 hours and 14 hours. On each trip, refilling is done at the location specified for each product category and each train. The refilling process aims to reduce the occurrence of food damage and decay during the trip. Thus, this paper will discuss the development of an inventory system model in a perishable product that aims to minimize the total supply chain costs by considering multi product, fixed lifetime, and probabilistic lead time.","['bullwhip', 'effect', 'food']"

"NIKEN DWI WAHYU CAHYANI (NIP: 00750052-1, NIDN: 0422097502)","In this paper, a digital investigation of electronic (e)-banking services on the Windows Phone platform of nine Indonesian banks is undertaken. In the experiments, banking transactions (balance check, funds transfer and phone credit purchase) are performed using a Nokia Lumia 625. The digital evidence resulting from these transactions is acquired and analyzed using mobile forensic tools from Cellebrite and Micro Systemation AB. In order to reconstruct the transaction events, evidence objects are identified and related events are sequenced. Specifically, the findings relating to mobile banking activities identify eight digital evidence objects (SMS, email, call log, contact, media file, network packets, location and installed apps), and a physical object (account book - obtained from a physical investigation). Investigation questions of who, what, when and how are answered from the acquired evidence and the event sequence diagrams. The findings contribute to a better understanding of available mobile banking evidence on Windows Phone devices. Advances in technologies including development of smartphone features have contributed to the growth of mobile applications, including dating apps. However, online dating services can be misused. To support law enforcement investigations, a forensic taxonomy that provides a systematic classification of forensic artifacts from Windows Phone 8 (WP8) dating apps is presented in this study. The taxonomy has three categories, namely: Apps Categories, Artifacts Categories, and Data Partition Categories. This taxonomy is built based on the findings from a case study of 28 mobile dating apps, using mobile forensic tools. The dating app taxonomy can be used to inform future studies of dating and related apps, such as those from Android and iOS platforms. Communication apps can be an important source of evidence in a forensic investigation (e.g. in the investigation of a drug trafficking or terrorism case where the communications apps were used by the accused persons during the transactions or planning activities). This study presents the first evidence-based forensic taxonomy of Windows Phone communication apps, using an existing two-dimensional Android forensic taxonomy as a baseline. Specifically, 30 Windows Phone communication apps, including Instant Messaging (IM) and Voice over IP (VoIP) apps, are examined. Artifacts extracted using physical acquisition are analyzed and seven digital evidence objects of forensic interest are identified, namely: Call Log, Chats, Contacts, Locations, Installed Applications, SMSs and User Accounts. Findings from this study would help to facilitate timely and effective forensic investigations involving Windows Phone communication apps. This study examines the usage of multimedia presentations with a particular focus on the presentation phase within a trial context. The aim is to understand the extent to which multimedia presentations increase a lay person???s understanding of technical terms and concepts in digital forensics. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted in Japan with 25 participants attending the United Nations Asia and Far East Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (UNAFEI) 160th international training course entitled ???Contemporary Digital Forensic Investigations???. Multimedia presentations in the form of videos were played with the aim of explaining three concepts: cloud computing, botnet and forensic file recovery. The findings of our survey showed that 84 of the participants had a better understanding after watching the videos. These results both support and extend findings from our previous research studies. The discussion on material classification, background culture and language issues, video material, and other tools that would facilitate understanding and the needs of an expert provide guidance for the practical implementation of multimedia presentations for their usage in a courtroom setting.","['forensic', 'phone', 'evidence']"
NIKMAH ISNAINI (1301168382),"News has become a basic human need along with the development of technology and the internet. The development of technology and the internet has led to the process of distributing information on the news shifting from the way of delivering the print media era to the digital era. Another problem that arises when classifying news is multi-label. The multi-label classification differs from the single label classification. Single label classification will classify a document into one label only. While multi-label classification can group a document to more than one label. For example, a news article in which to discuss in detail the early detection of ovarian cancer with a bioinformatics approach may have more than one label such as health, bioinformatics, and women. In this paper, a classification model was developed that was able to identify the classes in each news article multi-labeled using K-Nearest Neighbor method. Excess K-Nearest Neighbor is an algorithm that is very suitable for multi-label cases, even KNN can be superior to other classifiers. From the system that is made, the result of system performance value which measured with proximity measure that is a comparison between Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance and Supremum Distance using parameter K 11, yields Hamming Loss value 11,16 .","['news', 'classification', 'label']"

The electronic structure indicated that the interface state gets occupied unlike a typical rigid band picture as the number of Fe layers decreases, leading large perpendicular anisotropies in the oscillating behavior for its thickness dependence. The maximum of the MAE originating from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) reaches 2mJ/m^2 . It is found that the saddle point nature and dispersionless at the Fermi level may be an origin of its large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. To evaluate the MAE originating from SOI, the in-plane shape magnetic anisotropy originating from magnetic dipole interaction (MDI) was estimated. The calculated MAE from MDI required a suppression of the calculated total magnetization for realizing a fair agreement with an experimental MAE. With using a rescaled magnetization it was found that a possible perpendicular anisotropy may appear in the thickness range of experimental data.","['magnetic', 'anisotropy', 'mae']"
NUZULUL AULIA PERDANA PUTRA (1301144037),"Traffic congestion is often a problem in major cities causing economic and social harm, air and sound pollution, as well as delays in daily activities. Existing traffic assistant applications usually provide traffic prediction based on real-time traffic condition and typical traffic record during weekdays. Such a traffic prediction is not applicable to predict traffic for special moments, e.g. long weekends and national holidays, on which the number of vehicle is very much different compared to that on weekdays. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method for traffic prediction by combining poll, traffic records, and linear regression. The proposed method is evaluated by conducting a poll to traffic users on one of the roads nearby Telkom University, collecting the traffic record, estimating the future traffic condition using linear regression, and then comparing the predicted traffic condition with that of the actual traffic condition. The level of congestion is measured as the road???s level of service. The experiment result shows that the proposed method successfully predicts the traffic condition within the same class of level of service with the actual traffic condition. This confirms that the method is applicable for predicting traffic condition.

From related works, there are method called Fast Labelling and Interchange Position (FLIP) and Left with LeastAngle Movement (LAM) used to construct highest order voronoi diagram. But, both of this methods implemented on conventional computing/sequential processing and have limitation on number of points that can be processed. Because on sequential processing the process executed sequentially, then there is a process awaits for another process to finish. Beside that, computing resources are only utilized sequentially. To overcome this issues, we can use distributed computing framework that focuses on the optimization of computing resources called Apache Spark. In this paper we adapt FLIP and LAM construction method in Apache Spark framework.

Based on these problems, it is necessary to build a system that accommodates the needs both psychologically and materially from the side of children and parents. The existence of a detection system to assess the suitability between the two is to reduce the risk of violence in foster children. To build the system, it needs an algorithm capable of formulating several related factors. In this case, CARTs algorithm is an algorithm capable of predicting an optimal match that supports successful adoption of foster children.

The sea regulates the planet???s climate and is a significant source of nutrients. The sea becomes an essential part of global commerce, while the contents of the ocean become the solution of human energy needs today and the future. The wealth and potential of the sea as a source of energy for humans today and the future needs to be mapped and described to provide a picture of marine potential to all concerned. As part of the government, the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries is responsible for the process of formulating, determining, and implementing policies in the field of marine and fisheries based on the results of mapping and extracting information from existing conditions. The results of this information can be used to predict the marine potential in a marine area. This prediction process can be developed using data-mining techniques such as applying the association rule by looking at the relationship between the quantity of fish based on the plankton abundance index. However, this association rules data-mining techniques that require complete data, which are data sets with no missing values to generate interesting rules for detection systems. The problem is often that required marine data are not available or that marine data are available, but they contain incomplete data. To address this problem, this paper introduces a Relative Tolerance Relation of Rough Set (RTRS). Novelty RTRS differs from previous rough approaches that use tolerance relationships, nonsymmetric equation relationships, and limited tolerance relationships. The RTRS approach is based on a limited tolerance relationship considering the relative precision between two objects; therefore, this is the first job to use relative precision. In addition, this paper presents the mathematical approach of the RTRS and compares it with other existing approaches using the marine real dataset to classify the marine potential level of the region. The results show that the proposed approach is better than the existing approach in terms of accuracy. Rough set theory is an effective approach to imprecision, vagueness, and uncertainty. This theory overlaps with many other theories such that fuzzy sets, evidence theory, and statistics. From a practical point of view, it is a good tool for data analysis. However, classical rough set theory cannot cope with the incomplete information systems where some attribute values are missing. There have been efforts in studying incomplete information systems for data classification which are based on the extensions of rough set theory. Moreover, the existing approaches have their weaknesses in terms of inflexible and imprecise in data classifications. To overcome these issues, we propose a relative tolerance relation of rough set (RTRS) to handling incomplete information systems, which it has flexibility and precisely for data classification. We compared RTRS with the existing approaches, the results show that our proposed method relatively achieves higher flexibility and precisely in data classification in incomplete information systems.","['marine', 'data', 'information']"

In fact, it is possible that users share their accounts with other users, for example, a single shopping account in an online book store is used by three users in a household. Most recommender systems fail where multiple preferences are mixed in one shared account without contextual information for splitting the shared account. This paper discusses our study and implementation of COVER disambiguating item-based algorithm, a solution for shared account problems because of the absence of contextual information. It applies an item-based top-N collaborative filtering algorithm as a base algorithm. The algorithm aims to improve the item-based top-N collaborative filtering algorithm for tackling the generality, dominance, and presentation problems of the shared account. It has been tested using BookCrossing and Amazon review datasets and it generates recommendations based on binary and positive-only feedback. To conclude, the proposed COVER disambiguating item-based algorithm has been able to reduce the score of fraction at zero recall.

ROHAYANTI HASSAN,"Protein sequences can be classified based on their structure similarity and/or common evolutionary origin called structural class. Information on structural class is readily available, easing the protein structure and protein function probing. SCOP and CATH are two prominent classification schemes used to assign the structural class of proteins. Both schemes determine the structural class manually base on known protein tertiary structures. However, the quantity of known protein sequences is growing exponentially with respect to the quantity of known tertiary proteins structures. Although SCOP and CATH are examples of well-established databases that contain more reliable information of structural class, yet the lack of known structural class of protein due to the laborious wet-lab experimental routine limits the high-throughput structural class assignment. The fact that this is a tedious and time-consuming manually-determined method has further limited the structural class assignment. As a consequence, the assignment of structural class by computational method suffers from the arbitrated statistical inference. Thus, this study aims to provide a structural class prediction method that can acquire the knowledge of local protein structures, derived from known excessive primary sequences, in order to produce high-throughput sequencestructure class assignment instead of the laborious experimental based method.

SITI SA,"Operating and manipulating data in the graph database becomes most interesting topics to study further, especially concern about expansion of using graph database. By the growing number of data, a new problem arises in shortest path search in graph database. Since the shortest path search performance highly influenced by the amount of data. Tree decomposition-based indexing (TEDI) is one of the shortest path search methods that do search process by decomposing graph. In this way, the process of finding the shortest path would not be affected by the size of the graph. However, there are two main factor that influence this method to be well implemented in desired system, those are degree of reduction and density of the graph. Therefore, we conduct a research to find out the influence of those factor in TEDI so that this method can be implemented in our desired system. Our experimental results shown that the performance of index formation in the TEDI method is not influenced by the number of vertices on the graph, but it is influenced by the number of edges. The greater number of edges, the more solid a graph is. The denser a graph is, the lower the index formation performance. Then, in a case which a system that have limitations in the form of storage media capacity to store indexes, a large degree of reduction can be used, with the square of the degree of reduction having to be smaller than the number of vertices in the graph.","['graph', 'number', 'shortest']"
SON PA (2301153027),"Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) will play an important role in next-generation wireless communications involving wireless networks. The traffic in this network (WMN) often saturates on certain paths, causing congestion problems to occur. Currently, many proposed protocols have been created based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to contribute towards solving this particular problem. Unfortunately, most of these methods disregard the congestion problem after an optimal path is found. In this paper, a New Congestion Avoidance Method (NCAM) is proposed. NCAM is designed to improve load balancing by solving congestion problems after the optimal path is found. There are three mechanisms proposed in NCAM: detection of congestion in each optimal node to prepare a suboptimal path, updating of suboptimal pheromone value, and transferring data packets to the suboptimal path. We implemented our method in Network Simulator Version 2 and measured its effective performance compared to a family of existing ACO approaches in terms of packet throughput, end-to-end delay, and packet loss. The result demonstrates that NCAM provided better throughput, decreased end-to-end delay, and less packet loss compared to AntNet and CACO.","['congestion', 'wireless', 'proposed']"

SONY ADAN KALAMSYAH (1301158669),"Recently, a contract agreement or contract document was used as a legal requirement of the business deal. For securing the contract, authentication and encryption is necessary. In conventional contract, the contract owner (the sender) is authenticated by the client (the receiver). The authentication is conducted by verifying the owner???s signature using human vision. It is shown that the conventional contract has drawback when it was used to conduct long distance business. Since conventional agreement is using only digital signatures, the sender of the contract documents can be authenticated but there is still problem because both parties cannot perform mutual authentication and it cannot resolve legal dispute. Therefore, a witness was required, to overcome the problems when legal dispute was occurred. For implementing the witness, block chaining is proposed. There are several works that have been proposed for realizing authentication, and one of them is using RSA proposed by Raji et al. Since RSA needs large complexity, then in this research, ECC and ECDSA is proposed. ECC and ECDSA is proposed because it has less complexity than RSA. Based on the experiment result, it is shown that legal dispute can be resolved and the security level of the proposed method is greater than RSA. Meanwhile, the complexity of ECDSA is less than digital signature based on RSA.","['proposed', 'contract', 'rsa']"

This situation is further exacerbated by the behavior of city transport drivers who are less discipline in driving, or in picking up and dropping off their passengers. The bad behavior is partly caused by the low level of passenger occupancy. The drivers try to search for passengers as much as possible but often ignore the traffic rules. To overcome this problem, an optimal transport route with high passenger potential is required. Therefore, this study investigated the optimal route of city transport based on the passenger occupancy rate in the city of Bandung as the case study. The method employed for determining the optimal route is Genetic algorithm combined with Ordinary Kriging method used for the process of passenger prediction and fitness calculation. The optimal routes are those with higher occupancy rate. The analysis results showed that the use of the Genetic algorithm with a low number of generations succeed in creating new, more optimal routes even though the increase is not too high.","['optimal', 'city', 'transport']"

This paper will investigate the modelling of piezoelectric compliance and follow the procedures of FEA to accurately predict the dynamic behaviour of compliance. The parameters for simulation of piezoelectric are voltage, electromechanical coupling and frequency. The compliance mechanism is model by using SolidWorks 2014 and imported to Ansys Mechanical APDL Software were the piezoelectric are embedded on the mechanism. Modal analysis and harmonic analysis has been used in order to obtain the mode shape and displacement. The displacement of the compliance mechanism will be compare between simulation and experimental. The dynamic behaviour was discussed in simulation to study the reliability of the compliance mechanism before it safely used in UVAM Human Machine Interface (HMI) serves as a bridge for operators to understand the processes that occur in a production system. Without the HMI, operators have difficulty in monitoring and controlling the production system. It serves to facilitate the operator in monitoring the plant, plant control, plant handling, and access historical data either for the whole process or each of the existing equipment in the process. This paper presents an investigation on the simulation of wind and solar power hybrid systems through the human machine interface using software InTouch Wonderware. This simulation features a visualization of the process of charging wind power and solar power in a hybrid and charging process on battery and load. The simulated investigation results show that each power source produces a maximum of 100 KW, the total power charging is the sum of the two power sources, which is a maximum of 200 KW, the charging capacity of the battery is a maximum of 100 KW, and the duration usage at the load is a maximum of 100 KW converted to 10 hours load usage. With this HMI, operators can easily control the hybrid system in the power charging field. The potential of solar energy that is so large in Indonesia can be a driving force for the use of renewable energy as a solution for energy needs. Government with the community can utilize and optimize this technology to increase the electrification ratio up to 100 in all corners of Indonesia. Because of its modular and practical nature, making this technology easy to apply.

Before using the product, it is of course very important and immediately to undertake an in-depth study of the utilization, use, maintenance, repair, component supply and fabrication. The best way to know the above is through a review of the design and simulation. To meet this need, this paper presents a solar-smartflower design and then simulated using the facilities available in the solidwork program. Solid simulation express is a tool that serves to create power simulation of a design part modelling. With the simulation is very helpful at all to reduce errors in making design. Accurate or not a design created is also influenced by several other factors such as material objects, the silent part of the part, and the load given. The simulation is static simulation and body battery drop test, and based on the results of this simulation is known that the design results have been very satisfactory The Indonesian state of archipelago has great wind energy potential. For micro-scale power generation, the energy obtained from the windmill can be connected directly to the electrical load and can be used without problems. However, for macro-scale power generation, problems will arise such as the design of vane shapes, there should be a simulation and an accurate experiment to produce blades with a special shape that can capture wind energy. In addition, daily and yearly wind and wind rate calculations are also required to ensure the best latitude and longitude positions for building windmills. This paper presents a solution to solve the problem of how to produce a windmill which in the builder is very practical and very mobile can be moved its location. Before a windmill prototype is built it should have obtained the best windmill design result. Therefore, the simulation of the designed windmill is of crucial importance. Solid simulation express is a tool that serves to generate simulation of a design. Some factors that can affect a design result include the power part and the rest part of the part, material selection, the load is given, the security of the design power made, and changes in shape due to treat the load given to the design made. In this paper, static and thermal simulations of windmills have been designed. Based on the simulation result on the designed windmill, it shows that the design has been made very satisfactory so that it can be done prototyping fabrication process Energy consumption is a crucial issue for such as wind energy and solar energy. This source of energy must begin to be developed and controlled early, by changing the mindset not just as an alternative energy from fossil fuels but should be a buffer of the national energy supply.

Authentication model is one candidate to secure an object, but it is only limited to handle a specific type of attack such as Sybil attack. The authentication model cannot handle other types of attack such as trust-based attacks. This paper proposed two-phase security protection for objects in IoT. The proposed method combined authentication and statistical models. The results showed that the proposed method could handle other attacks in addition to Sybil attacks, such as bad-mouthing attack, good-mouthing attack, and ballot stuffing attack. Keywords Internet of Things, security, authentication, statistic, attacks The Internet of Things (IoT) objects can behave as a harmless or a harmful object while interacting with others. Harmful behavior can be described as an object launching a trust-based attack or a on-off attack to others. In trust management environment, the detection of harmless and harmful behavior of an object is an important issue, to create a safe IoT environment. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the on-off attacks for IoT objects. The proposed method consists of the process of detecting a trust-based attack and on-off attack that might be carried out by an object, process of limiting the number of those attacks, and finally block the attacker object. The simulation results show that this method is quite feasible to be applied to IoT objects and is able to produce a fairly short detection time.","['attack', 'objects', 'method']"

WIDODO SETYO YUWONO (1301140194),"There are many theft cases which happen because there is no tool used as a guard. Based on the situation mentioned, the house owner tends to use a surveillance camera to guard their properties, especially an important area such as house rooms. However, in general, the traditional surveillance camera is a passive device which has no notification feature to inform the house owner. Indeed, it also has no ability to recognize a human existence. So that, the object detection related to the human and also the notification corresponds a criminal action which is going to be acted by the suspected human is really needed. According to the object detection as the human being, there is an image processing needed to treat the picture which is captured by the surveillance camera. There are many ways to improve the object detection performance of the surveillance camera. One of them is by making a captured image sample which is caught by the surveillance camera. Firstly, the human is a moving object. So that, it is necessary to select the method which is related to the moving object detection to make a sampled image. One of the methods which can be applied is the Background Subtraction. When the moving target is known and is sampled, then the next step is by separating the human by classifying it from the object. In this study, human detection is generated by using Face Detection for the first mechanism and for the second mechanism is Head and Shoulders Detection. Both mechanisms are formed in master/slave. Thus, if the master function which is the Face Detection cannot recognize the object as a human, then the Head and Shoulders detection is going to be shown. The inability of master function for detection happens because of less illumination, or an obstacle such as the human face appears in the opposite direction from the lens of the camera. To minimize the detection failure, the night vision feature is also presented in this study for the surveillance camera prototyping. The human object detection by using the Head and Shoulders method as slave feature is still established for minimizing the failure probability. The proposed system works properly, especially when the system uses the combination of Face Detection and also Head and Shoulders method. The usage of night vision feature also improves the accuracy for detecting the object moves more than 80 in several variations of illumination.","['detection', 'human', 'object']"

This paper proposes a model for generating a travel route schedule within a few days, and considers some user needs criteria, so that the determination of a travel route can be considered as a multi-criteria issue. The travel route is generated based on several constraints, such as travel time limits per day, opening/closing hours and the average length of visit for each tourist destination. We use simulated annealing method to generate the optimum travel route. Based on evaluation result, the optimality of the travel route generated by the system is not significantly different with ant colony result. However, our model is far more superior in running time compared to Ant Colony method Travelling is one of the activities needed by everyone to overcome weariness.

For generating itinerary, the system considers several criterias (Multi-criteria-based), which include the popularity level of tourist attractions to visit, tourist visits that minimize budgets or tourist visits with as many destinations as possible. To handle multi-criteria-based itinerary, we use the concept of multi attribute utility theory (MAUT). Based on the test results, the running time from multi criteria-based itinerary is not significantly different from time-based itinerary. In addition, the number of tourist attractions in the itinerary is more than time-based itinerary, because the combination of solutions from each ant becomes more diverse.","['travel', 'route', 'tourist']"
