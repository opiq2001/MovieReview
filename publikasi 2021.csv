Consequently, the number of cyberattacks such as phishing has increased. Phishing websites can be detected using machine learning by classifying the websites into legitimate or illegitimate websites. The purpose of the study is to conduct a mini-review of the existing techniques and implement experiments to detect whether a website is malicious or not. The dataset consists of 11,055 observations and 32 variables. Three supervised learning models are implemented in this study: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Random Forest. The three algorithms are chosen because it provides a better understanding and more suitable for the dataset. Based on the experiments undertaken, the result shows Decision Tree has an accuracy of 91.16 which is the lowest compared to the other models, 97.6 for the KNN model which is the highest among all the models and 94.44 accuracy for the Random Forest model. Through comparisons between the three models, KNN was the prime candidate for the best model considering that it has the highest accuracy. However, Random Forest is deemed more suitable for the dataset even though the accuracy is lesser because of the lowest false-negative value than the other models. The experiments can be further investigated with different datasets and models for comparative analysis."

However, it is already becoming evident that some of the more demanding requirements for MTC cannot be fully supported by 5G networks. Alongside, emerging use cases and applications towards 2030 will give rise to new and more stringent requirements on wireless connectivity in general and MTC in particular. Next generation wireless networks, namely 6G, should therefore be an agile and efficient convergent network designed to meet the diverse and challenging requirements anticipated by 2030. This paper explores the main drivers and requirements of MTC towards 6G, and discusses a wide variety of enabling technologies. More specifically, we first explore the emerging key performance indicators for MTC in 6G. Thereafter, we present a vision for an MTC-optimized holistic end-to-end network architecture. Finally, key enablers towards (i) ultra-low power MTC, (ii) massively scalable global connectivity, (iii) critical and dependable MTC, and (iv) security and privacy preserving schemes for MTC are detailed.

Given this advantages, this method suffers from heavy computational process. In this paper we propose dimensionality reduction of image samples to reduce the computational burden. This reduction is performed by multiplying the feature matrix with random projection matrix (??) of smaller size than feature matrix A. Two random projection matrices are generated using Gaussian and Uniform distribution. Several reduction factor in matrix ?? are verified which are from 1 to 256, are evaluated. Higher reduction factor indicates higher dimensionality reduction. As a reference we compared the proposed reduction method to the classical linear down scaling the image. The simulation results on AT&T Dataset that consist of 400 images shows that the proposed method with reduction factor of 8 to 256, achieve recognition rate higher than the classical linear down-scaled method. In addition, the proposed method also shows a better recognition rate up to 5 to the original SRC method."

In order to evaluate the condition of synergy that initiates group living, we build a model of food intake based on three types of functional response. We show that type III functional response is prerequisite for synergy to allow group living. The optimal number of gathering individuals can be also evaluated from Type III functional response curve. Type III functional response consists of terms depending linearly and bilinearly on the number of individuals and the bilinear term represents synergy. For a fixed value of the linear coefficient, there are upper and lower boundaries of the bilinear coefficient for synergistic collaboration. The dilution effect can be incorporated into the model through the functional response of the predator. Thus, the functional response of the predator as well as that of the prey contribute to the group living of the prey. Our model shows that group livings can be categorized into three types, namely those due to (1) synergy effect of the own group, (2) dilution effect against predators, and (3) both effects contributing together. The predator's functional response plays a decisive role in the last two types, where the predator response should be of anti-Type III (i.e., Type II)."

But in monitoring the height of the plant, people who want to plant hydroponics or who are doing it at home still estimate without knowing exactly, so there are plants whose height is not well monitored. These problems created an idea to create a detection system for plant growth and development to detect height more accurately. Image Processing is a branch of knowledge about image processing that is processed digitally. The development of technology is speedy in computer vision that makes image processing not only to improve the image alone but also to detect or track an object, read barcodes, and others. The stages when doing image processing are acquiring images from images, preprocessing, and recognition. The method used in this system is the Morphological Image Processing method. The parameter used is to calculate the height of the Pak Choy hydroponic plant. Using this method, we obtained an accuracy of the system of 93.81 with a light intensity of 15.7 lux.

In 2013, Li-Takagi et al. proposed a deniable authentication scheme. However, Li-Takagi's scheme has weaknesses if the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. In this case, the third party can identify the source of a given message. In the proposed method, zero-knowledge proof is introduced to preserve the anonymity of the deniable authentication scheme when the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. Based on the analysis, the proposed scheme fulfills the requirement of the deniable authentication scheme when the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. However, the proposed scheme has additional computation costs for securing the shared secret key. Two attack schemes thet are carried out on both Li-Takagi and the proposed scheme are the MITM attack and the impersonation attack.

A Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) was designed on the ground plane of the FR4 substrate with a rectangular patch antenna on the top plane for antenna size miniaturization, bandwidth improvement, compactness, and isolation enhancement. At first, the presence of the CSRR on the conventional antenna creates additional frequency bands and reduces the frequency of the conventional patch antenna from 24.2 GHz to 5.8 GHz. Even though the CSRR as radiating elements are closer to each other at ??/4 in the MIMO design, minimum isolation is achieved by limiting the unnecessary surface current flow that exists between the elements of the antenna. Consequently, an orthogonal method of the antenna element is adopted for the four-port MIMO antenna system with high port-toport measured isolation of less than ???? 19 dB, ???? 18 dB, and ???22 dB for 2.4 GHz, 2.9 GHz, and 5.8 GHz frequency bands respectively.

The results also provided overall good diversity performances with the ECC < 0.01, DG > 9.98, MEG < 3 dB, and TARC in all of the proposed multi-band MIMO antenna systems at respective frequencies. The reflection & transmission coefficients, surface currents, radiation patterns, total efficiency, and diversity parameters are presented and discussed. Moreover, the proposed integration of CSRR with the antenna for MIMO antenna arrays has the advantage of multi-band operation, size reduction, isolation enhancement, good diversity, and high gain performances. With this, it is possible to conclude that the proposed metamaterial multi-band MIMO antenna is the right candidate for WLAN applications."

The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled ???Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,??? collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques???Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Na??ve Bayes???were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8 sensitivity, 82.1 precision and 87.6 F-score; utilities discount with 86 sensitivity, 82.1 precision and 84 F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6 sensitivity, 81.2 precision and 82.4 F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance. Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP.

Multi-beam antennas with high directivity are required for a 5G mobile network. It can be achieved by having an array antenna. Using an antenna array at low frequency increases the complexity and size of the whole network. Therefore, a metasurface (MS) is proposed to direct surface current and to have high gain and multibeam properties. To achieve that, a square split ring resonator (SSRR) and U-shaped unit cell metasurface is implemented as a superstrate to a single square patch antenna. The manipulation of this hybrid metasurface configuration can create opposite current flow on the unit cell and thus split the beam. The hybrid metasurface superstrate and antenna are fabricated on FR-4 ( ??r 4.4 , tan ?? 0.02 ). Results show that the antenna resonates well at 3.5 GHz, with a less than ???10 dB reflection coefficient. The arrangement of the unit cells on the superstrate metasurface is able to split the current, and thus the radiation pattern beam is split into two beams in the E-plane at ?? 45??.

Budget deficit policies in many developing countries have a positive impact on economic growth, but some have a negative impact. Therefore, the role of foreign debt on economic growth is still a major problem and is interesting to be studied further. Based on this, this study aims to analyze the influence of foreign debt on economic growth and the factors that influence it. This research is descriptive and verification using secondary data sourced from the BPS-Statistic Indonesia, and Indonesian Financial Statistics (BI), as well as International Financial Statistics (IFS) for the period 2000-2019. This study uses multiple linear regression analysis technique, namely the method of Two Stage Least Square (TSLS) which is recursive. The results showed that the exchange rate and GDP variables had a positive effect on foreign debt, while FDI had a negative effect on foreign debt. As for the impact of foreign debt, government spending, lending interest rate and trade openness simultaneously they affect economic growth. However, partially foreign debt had a significant negative effect on Indonesia's economic growth. This happens because foreign debt is not fully used for investment or capital expenditure, but part of it is used to pay principal debt installment and loan interest rate. Thus, controlling the exchange rate and proper management of foreign debt must be carried out in an effort to increase economic growth. On the other hand, foreign direct investment (FDI) contributions have not been able to fully replace foreign debt as a source of capital for Indonesia's development. In analyzing Indonesia's economic growth, there are many variables that cause it, in this study limited to several important variables that can affect economic growth. This study does not involve the variables of domestic consumption and investment by the private sector. These two variables can be added to further research, to be more comprehensive in analyzing Indonesia's economic growth.

We have encountered many paintings that present Sundanese art in West Java, such as Wayang Golek, Jaipong dance, or elements of Batik motifs which have become synonymous with Sundanese styles presented in urban communities. The emergence of the traditional style by Sundanese painters is like inviting us to an understanding of painting with traditional art objects as an icon of Sundanese itself. In this study, using a descriptive qualitative methodology approach by analyzing various kinds of literature data as well as data from interviews and observations that support the research. This study uses an art-critical approach to interpreting the work, and only focuses on paintings that contain Sundanese traditional art.

The analysis considers its performance under two impairments, symbol time offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) in frequency-selective fading channel. As orthogonal multicarrier system, OFDM-IM is subject to both inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) in a frequency-selective fading channel. OFDM-IM is a new multicarrier communication system, where the active subcarriers indices are used to carry additional bits of information. In general, in the previous existing works, OFDM-IM are evaluated only for near-ideal communication scenarios by only incorporating the CFO factor. In this work, the OFDM-IM performance is investigated and compared with conventional OFDM in the presence of two impairments, STO and CFO. Simulation results show that OFDM-IM outperforms the conventional OFDM with the presence of STO and CFO, especially at high SNR areas."

Some of the factors that cause the high prevalence of stunting in children are caused by the behavior of the mother in providing a balanced nutritional intake, adopting a clean and healthy lifestyle, and giving exclusive breastfeeding and complementary foods that are nutritionally balanced. This study aims to reveal the factors influencing young mothers' communication behavior intentions in preventing stunting in West Java. This study also uses the theoretical framework of Ajzen and Madden (1986) on planned behavior. The research respondents were 176 people who came from locations with the highest prevalence rate of stunting in West Java, namely West Bandung Regency, Garut, Sumedang, and Karawang. The research design used a survey approach. The results showed that there was a strong influence of attitudes, social norms, and control beliefs related to behavior on the intention of young mothers to participate in stunting prevention in West Java. The attitude of young mothers in preventing stunting has a very strong effect (r 0.506 ***) on the intention to provide a balanced nutritional intake, the application of clean and healthy living habits, as well as exclusive breastfeeding and nutritionally balanced complementary foods. Meanwhile, family support, health workers and the surrounding community (social norm) have a significant effect on the intention of young mothers in preventing stunting with a coefficient value of 0.139 *. Furthermore, the perceive behavioral control dimension has a very strong influence (r 0.412 *) on the intention to provide balanced nutritional intake, the application of clean and healthy living habits, as well as exclusive breastfeeding and nutritionally balanced complementary solids in an effort to prevent stunting in children. The results of multiple regression analysis revealed that the three variables were able to explain the intention to prevent stunting by 45.2 percent, while the most important predictor of intention was the dimension of young mothers' attitudes towards the importance of stunting prevention behavior. These findings provide essential applied information that can be used to inform future strategies to increase participation rates in stunting prevention in West Java.

These underrepresented classes are referred to as a minority, while the overrepresented ones are called the majority. The unequal distribution of data leads to the machine's inability to carry out predictive accuracy in determining the minority classes, thereby causing various costs of classification errors. Currently, the standard framework used to solve the unequal distribution of imbalanced data learning is the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). However, SMOTE can produce synthetic minority data samples considered as noise, which is also part of the majority classes. Therefore, this study aims to improve SMOTE to identify the noise from synthetic minority data produced in handling imbalanced data by adding the Local Outlier Factor (LOF). The proposed method is called SMOTE-LOF, and the experiment was carried out using imbalanced datasets with the results compared with the performance of the SMOTE. The results showed that SMOTE-LOF produces better accuracy and f-measure than the SMOTE. In a dataset with a large number of data examples and a smaller imbalance ratio, the SMOTE-LOF approach also produced a better AUC than the SMOTE. However, for a dataset with a smaller number of data samples, the SMOTE's AUC result is arguably better at handling imbalanced data. Therefore, future research needs to be carried out using different datasets with combinations varying from the number of data samples and the imbalanced ratio.

To create a user-centered service composition, some general needs must be met, namely: making it easier for users to obtain appropriate services, guaranteeing the fulfillment of Quality of Service (QoS), and visualizing composite services that are generated instantly. The resulting services meet external requirements submitted directly by users and pay attention to user preferences as internal (implicit) requirements. This paper presents various studies that have been produced to support the composition of user-centered services and problems that are still open as to research challenges in the future. This study's results are exspected to help service composition platform developers understand the various approaches to developing user-centered service composition."

The difference in hormone levels makes the two genders distinguishable from several aspects. One of the things that are influenced by hormones is sweat. The odor of sweat is related to the apocrine glands found in human armpits. This experiment studied the classification of both genders based on daytime sweat in adult human armpits. The sampling method used an electronic nose (E-nose) system to collect the armpit sweat odor. The E-nose system sensor array consisted of seven sensors: TGS 822, TGS 2612, TGS 2620, TGS 826, TGS 2603, TGS 2600, and TGS 813. These sensors generate resistance ratio (Rs/Ro) values which are learned by the machine learning methods for classification and disease potential based on the volatile organic compound (VOC) in sweat. The study shows the male samples have higher amine gas than female samples, one of which is Trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is a compound that will be broken down into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a factor to various cardiovascular diseases.

The common practice to generate phrase tables in pivot approaches is to use standard symmetrization, i.e., grow-diag-final-and. Although some researchers found that the use of non-standard symmetrization could improve bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores, the use of non-standard symmetrization has not been commonly employed in pivot approaches. In this study, we propose a strategy that uses the non-standard symmetrization of word alignment in phrase table combination. The appropriate symmetrization is selected based on the highest BLEU scores in each direct translation of source???target, source???pivot, and pivot???target of Kazakh???English (Kk???En) and Japanese???Indonesian (Ja???Id). Our experiments show that our proposed strategy outperforms the direct translation in Kk???En with absolute improvements of 0.35 (a 11.3 relative improvement) and 0.22 (a 6.4 relative improvement) BLEU points for 3-gram and 5-gram, respectively.

Studies have shown that improper data handling leads to inaccurate analysis. Furthermore, most studies indicate the occurrence of missing data irrespective of the correlation between attributes. However, an adaptive search procedure helps to determine the estimates of the missing data when correlations between attributes are considered in the process. Firefly Algorithm (FA) implements an adaptive search procedure in the imputation of the missing data by determining the estimated value closest to others' value. Therefore, this study proposes a class center-based adaptive approach model for retrieving missing data by considering the attribute correlation in the imputation process (C3-FA). The result showed that the class center-based firefly algorithm (FA) is an efficient technique for obtaining the actual value in handling missing data with the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and root mean squared error (RMSE) close to 1 and 0, respectively.

Triangulation and linear interpolation (LI) approaches were used to combine multiple pivot phrase tables. The combination of phrase tables was employed without a source???target phrase table. In the WoR experiment, the use of multiple pivots improved the BLEU scores by 0.24 and 2.49 compared to the baseline and single pivot, respectively. However, the translation output of WoR was incomprehensible because it followed the Japanese word order. In the WR experiment, we reordered the Japanese word order, that is, subject???object???verb (SOV), into Indonesian word order, that is, subject???verb???object (SVO) using the Lader (Latent Derivation Reorderer). The multiple pivots of WR improved the BLEU scores by 0.47 compared with the baseline. Furthermore, by combining many pivot languages, the BLEU score was improved by more than 0.20. The translation output of WR is also more comprehensible than that of WoR.

Many studies have developed rapid detection for adulterated meat. However, these studies are not yet practical and economical methods and instruments and a faster analysis process. In this context, this paper proposes the Optimized Electronic Nose System (OENS) for more accurately detecting pork adulteration in beef. OENS has advantages such as proper noise filtering, an optimized sensor array, and optimized support vector machine (SVM) parameters. Noise filtering is carried out by cross-validation with different mother wavelets, i.e., Haar, dmey, coiflet, symlet, and Daubechies. The sensor array was optimized by dimension reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). An algorithm is proposed for the optimization of the SVM parameters. An experiment was conducted by analyzing seven classes of meat, comprising seven different mixtures of beef and pork. The first and seventh classes were 100 beef and 100 pork, respectively, while the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth classes contained 10 , 25 , 50 , 75 , and 90 of beef in a sample of 100 grams, respectively. Sample testing was carried out for 15 minutes for each sample. The classification test results to detect beef and pork had an accuracy of 98.10 using the optimized support vector machine. Thus, OENS has a favorable performance to detect pork adulteration in beef for halal authentication."

It can also decrease a study's statistical power or result in inaccurate estimations and conclusions. Hence, data normalization and missing value handling are considered the major problems in the data pre-processing stage, while classification algorithms are adopted to handle numerical features. In cases where the observed data contained outliers, the missing value estimated results are sometimes unreliable or even differ greatly from the true values. Therefore, this study aims to propose the combination of normalization and outlier removals before imputing missing values on the class center-based firefly algorithm method (ON+C3FA). Moreover, some standard imputation techniques like mean, a random value, regression, as well as multiple imputation, KNN imputation, and decision tree (DT)-based missing value imputation were utilized as a comparison of the proposed method. Experimental results on the sonar dataset showed normalization and outlier removals effect in the methods.

The alternative is to view the event log as an asset that can be explored without using a normative process model. This paper proposes a statistical test of heteroscedasticity in event log data. The heteroscedasticity test used the Glejser test with a 95 confidence interval. Then the heteroscedasticity test results from the event log are compared with the results of normative process modelling with the Inductive Miner algorithm using the Process Mining application. The comparison results show that the detected event log data having heteroscedasticity problems will ensure a bottleneck condition in the process model. The approach taken can be an alternative in evaluating the process model based on its event log."

Using system GMM, the result shows that on average the wage spillover in production jobs within an industry positively affects the TFP, while the wage spillover in non-production jobs contributes negatively. Moreover, the wage spillover in production jobs and non-production jobs within a province do not affect the TFP of Indonesian manufacturing firms. These results indicate that employees in production jobs have larger contributions to increasing TFP than those in non-production jobs when foreign firms increase their wages. Such contributions occur within an industry, not within a province. For the Government, the different contributions to the TFP of firms from wage spillovers in production and non-production jobs indicate the importance of skill mobility to the national economy."

The analysis model used was the most appropriate from Common, Fixed Effect Model (FEM), Random Effect Model (REM), and Generalized Method of Moment (GMM). ASEAN members' balance trade reached a different steady-state for every country, therefore convergence pattern did not take place, and the divergence pattern occurred in trade balance among the member countries. The divergent trade balance was due to the different early economic conditions, macroeconomic development, trade openness, and trade facilities and infrastructures in each country. It was also due to the ASEAN intra-trade cooperative role and low investment coming from intra-ASEAN foreign investment. To promote trade and lower divergent trade balance, it is necessary to promote intra-ASEAN trade and create a conducive situation for foreign capital investors.

However, micro and small businesses have the advantage and flexibility in adapting quickly to changes efficiently to the business environment's dynamics. The results of several previous studies on big data have revealed that even though the potential is significant, micro and small businesses have problems with processing big data to produce meaningful information. Another phenomenon indicates that the era of digital marketing euphoria still does not guarantee micro and small businesses succeed. They have not been able to utilize data and do not understand the concept of marketing. Small businesses ability to use data is a crucial factor in creating new development for business continuity, accompanied by establishing relationships based on data. This study aims to identify and determine micro and small businesses' ability to create creative value and quality of relationships by utilizing big data marketing. The research method used is quantitative research with a causality approach and statistical testing tools to test big data marketing variables and the relationship's quality directly and indirectly to the value creation variable. Respondents of this study were 150 micro and small businesses in Bandung Regency, West Java. The results of the study indicate that there is a positive and significant influence between big data on relationship quality and between big data on value creation.

Electrolysis of pure water will create hydrogen gas on the cathode side and oxygen gas on the anode side. Mineral water electrolysis can produce alkaline water and acidic water, which is beneficial for improving public health. Alkaline water can use to drink-health, while acidic water can serve as an external medicine. The maximum pH standard for drinking water set by WHO (2006) and the Indonesian Ministry of Health (2010) are 9.5 and 8.5.Currently, the equipment for producing alkaline water and continuous acidic water is available on the market; however, has a weakness, which is that it is still quite expensive and not yet affordable to the general public. There is a batch type mineral water electrolysis device that is relatively inexpensive, but there are still many shortcomings, including a long reaction rate, large electrical energy. The composition of the water content of the production results from continuous and batch types has not been tested analytically both in quality and quantity, besides that the theory underlying the process has not been explained in the literature. This research intends to develop and modify a batch-type water electrolysis process with the energy source of the electrolysis instrument coming from the sun through the solar cell module stored in the battery; the voltage can be increased and regulated by a power electronic converter. The electrolysis instrument is designed to facilitate the formation or efficient production of acidic and alkaline water, so in such a way that not much hydrogen gas at the cathode side and oxygen gas at the anode side were generated simultaneously. The results of the mineral water electrolysis experiment at an average voltage of 46 volts and an average volume of 1400 mL for one hour required an average current of 61 mA, the average current efficiency for alkaline and acid water formation of 3.35 , and 9.47 , the average pH values for acids and bases are 3.8 and 9.0, the amount of water that becomes hydrogen and oxygen gas is only 0.021mL or about 0. 0015 . The test results on PDAM water in Cibenying-Kaler, Bandung city of Indonesia, showed that the number of mineral ions Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, NO3-, and SO42- before electrolysis were respectively: 24.03; 7.92; 23.8; 51.69; and 3.69 mg/L, after electrolysis at the anode side were respectively: 7.07; 5.15; 110; 97.39; and 10.39 mg/L, at the cathode side were: 25.75; 9,54; 10.7; 31.04; and 0.65 mg/These values indicate that the alkaline water content on the cathode side meets potable standards. The final result of this research is that a portable mineral water electrolysis instrument has been made, not only using solar energy (off-Grid) sources but also using AC voltage (on-Grid) from the national electricity company, so that it can be easily used by the community."

Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the cost by compressing the seismic data. In this work, we propose a model-based compression scheme to deal with the large data volume. First, each seismic trace is modeled as a superposition of multiple exponential decaying sinusoidal waves (EDSWs). Each EDSW represents a model component and is determined by a set of parameters. Secondly, a single component parameter estimation algorithm is proposed accordingly using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. We extend the algorithm for multiple model components by sequentially estimating the parameter set wave by wave. A suitable number of model components for each trace is selected according to the level of the residual energy. Next, the residuals are encoded using quantization coding techniques to improve the reconstruction quality. Comparison of PSO, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Simulated Annealing (SA) is presented where the proposed model estimation technique outperforms the comparative methods and model. The proposed model-based compression scheme is experimentally compared with the discrete cosine transform (DCT) on a real seismic dataset. The performance of the proposed model-based exhibits superiority to that of the DCT."

The use of certification schemes is becoming more critical to assure the security of services offered. This situation is problematic because many certification schemes aim to demonstrate compliance with a security standard rather than achieve a specified security level. Despite the benefits of security certification schemes like Common Criteria (CC), an assurance-based certification process does not scale well to service provision. To this end, this paper aims to investigate the concept of system assurance and trustworthiness in service provisioning, especially when government agencies procure cloud-based services. By using work on the Indonesian Government???s data confidentiality requirements, this work develops principles as foundations for a trustworthy data security level agreement (TDSLA) capability framework as a new assurance mechanism for service provisioning based on discrete levels of security assurance incorporated into the formulation of a service level agreement (SLA). The principles which have emerged from the empirical qualitative data collection were evaluated and validated using four approaches: 1) reflection against related work; 2) testimonial validity through participants??? feedback; 3) use cases, and 4) application of transferability using cases from the UK Government Cloud (G-Cloud) and the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).

Levenshtein and N-gram distance are utilised to predict the correct word of misspelling from English dictionary. Then, the result of both algorithms is observed and evaluated using recall metric to determine which technique works more effective. This is the first study that compares two spelling correction algorithms on identifying the common type of spelling error. The result of this study shows that Levenshtein works well to correct substitution single letter and transposition two sequenced letters, while N-gram operates effectively to fix the word with letter omission. The overall result is then evaluated by recall measurement to see which technique that works well on correcting the misspellings. Since the recall of Levenshtein is higher than N-gram, it is concluded that the frequency of misspelling words which are correctly fixed by Levenshtein occurs more often."

The personality type is adjusted to the job description that must be done by the selected individual. Maximum individual performance is the reason why personality tests are needed by organizations. The personality test method commonly used is to get a response in the form of a written answer from a questionnaire. Another method is proposed which takes into account individual facial expressions. Both methods use an iterative process to achieve consistency in individual responses. The repetition process is carried out with a limited frequency and the implementation takes a long time. This limited frequency has the potential to cause errors in inferring personality types. Inconsistent responses from individuals identified with personality types make the reliability level of personality tests less than optimal. Reliability that is not optimal can have a negative impact on decision-making in the selection of selected human resources. Based on these problems, this study proposes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to confirm individual personality types. The EEG used is a stimulated wave because the individual sees a visual form known as Visual Evoked Potential (VEP). Visual stimulus is the user interface design of a job support application. The stimulus is generated with a lot of frequency so that it can be relied on in knowing the consistent response. It is hoped that the recorded VEP pattern will reach a very good permanent level. An excellent permanent VEP rate can be determined by comparing between recording sessions. The permanent level of the VEP becomes the actual individual VEP. VEP comparisons between individuals will be compared for the classification process. The resulting classification is expected to show that individual VEP corresponds to each individual's personality type from the results of personality tests carried out by conventional methods."

Data transfer, CPU usage, memory usage, and execution time are measured in each trial. Based on research and experiments that have been carried out, the JSON data format consumes bandwidth with an average value smaller than the XML data format; this occurs in MongoDB, CouchDB, and RethinkDB. In CPU usage, JSON data format, on average, consumes less CPU compared to the XML data format. This is the case with MongoDB. While on CouchDB and RethinkDB, the average CPU usage for XML and JSON data formats does not show a significant difference. The average memory usage for the JSON data format is smaller than the XML data format. The average execution time of the XML data format a little faster than the JSON data format."

High waves were observed not only at the bay???s head but also in several other locations along the bay. This high amplification is most likely influenced by Palu Bay???s bathymetry and the underwater sill in front of Palu City. The numerical simulations of the two-dimensional shallow water equations were used to investigate these aspects. The numerical scheme is validated first with analytical solutions of standing waves in a parabolic bay, as a model of Palu Bay. The results show a significant amplification at the bay???s head, as a result of the bay???s reduced cross-sectional area. Some amplifications were also observed along the channel sides, and the role of the underwater sill was also investigated. Next, we carried out simulations with the actual Palu Bay bathymetry and a hypothetical tsunami $N-$wave and/or Gaussian humps. The simulation result depicts extremely high waves recorded along the Palu Bay coastline, which is consistent with the field survey; additionally, the wave signal at Pantoloan corresponds reasonably well to the tide gauge data. These findings indicate that Palu Bay???s bathymetry plays an important role in local wave amplification."

In preliminary studies, the electrophysiological effects of the hERG L532P mutation were investigated using a mathematical model in a single-cell and 2D sheet medium. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of the KCNH2 L532P mutation on the 3D ventricular electrophysiological behavior and the mechanical pumping responses. We used a realistic three-dimensional ventricular electrophysiological???mechanical model, which was adjusted into two conditions: the wild-type (WT) condition, i.e., the original case of the Tusscher et al. model, and the L532P mutation condition, with modification of the original IKr equation. The action potential duration (APD) in the mutant ventricle was reduced by 73 owing to the significant increase of the IKr current density. In the 3D simulation, the L532P mutation maintained the sustainability of reentrant waves; however, the reentry was terminated in the WT condition. The contractility of the ventricle with L532P mutation was significantly reduced compared with that in WT which results in sustain shivering heart during reentry condition. The reduction of the contractility was associated with the shortening APD which simultaneously shortened the duration of the Ca2+ channel opening. In conclusion, the ventricle with KCNH2 L532P mutation is prone to reentry generation with a sustained chaotic condition, and the mutation significantly reduced the pumping performance of the ventricles."

Clinical and computational studies have reported that spatial fibrosis pattern and fibrosis amount play a significant role in ventricular arrhythmogenicity. This study investigated the effect of the spatial distribution of fibrosis and fibrosis amount on the electrophysiology and mechanical performance of the human ventricles. Seventy-five fibrosis distributions comprising diffuse, patchy, and compact fibrosis types that contain 10 ???50 fibrosis amount were generated. The spatial fibrosis distribution was quantified using fibrosis entropy (FE) metric. Electrical simulations under reentry conditions induced using the S1-S2 protocol were conducted to investigate the fibrosis arrhythmogenicity. We also performed mechanical simulations to examine the influence of the fibrosis amount and spatial distribution of fibrosis on the pumping efficacy of the LV. We observed that the mean FE of the compact type is the largest among the three types. The electrical simulation results revealed that the ventricular arrhythmogenicity of diffuse fibrosis depends on the fibrosis amount and marginally on the spatial distribution of fibrosis. Meanwhile, the ventricular arrhythmogenicity of the compact and patchy fibrosis pattern is more reliant on the spatial distribution of fibrosis than on the fibrosis amount. The average number of phase singularities (PS) in the compact fibrosis pattern was the highest among the three patterns of fibrosis. The diffuse type of fibrosis has the lowest average number of PS than that in the patchy and compact fibrosis. The reduction in the stroke volume (SV) showed high influence from the electrical instabilities induced by the fibrosis amount and pattern. The compact fibrosis exhibited the lowest SV among the three patterns except in the 40 fibrosis amount. In conclusion, the fibrosis pattern is as crucial as the fibrosis amount for sustaining and aggravating ventricular arrhythmogenesis."

Protein kinase G is a primary target for treating malaria due to its essential role in Plasmodium falciparum life cycle. In this present study, several computational approaches such as QSAR modeling, molecular docking, and all-atom MD simulation are performed to screen 36 drug candidates against malaria. From QSAR analysis, three potent drugs are selected based on the strong correlation between the inhibitory action, i.e., pEC50 and various descriptors. Further, those selected drugs are used as ligand molecules for molecular docking. We predict three complexes of models 1, 2, and 3 bind to the catalytic site of protein kinase G, suggesting those ligands may become potent inhibitors for Plasmodium falciparum. To validate the structural stability of those complexes, the parameters of RMSD, RMSF, and Rg of all models are calculated from the trajectories of MD simulation. All complexes are stable along simulation since no signi???cant ???uctuations are observed in those validity parameters. Moreover, the binding energy is estimated at each complex by using MM-GBSA method to determine the most stable structure in the water solvent. Assumed from the lowest binding energy, model 2 may become the most stable structure. Therefore, the snapshot structure of model 2 is extracted to analyze the conformational changes of the complex. The side chain of ligand becomes large ???uctuation during the simulation. This ???uctuation may increase the probability of the ligand in binding with the receptor. Finally, based on our simulations by computational approaches, three ligands are assumed to have potential as inhibitors of protein kinase G and the ligand of model 2 may become the most promising drug against malaria."

Research on health data can help the government in improving health services, overcoming health problems, National development, etc. One method that is currently being developed in the field of health statistics is classification. Classification is one of the popular sciences in data mining, one of the goals of classification is to predict data based on the model formed. The Prediction was used to see the accuracy of the model in describing a data state. The classification method commonly used in the health sector is based on traditional statistical methods, it is expected to give ideal results when the sample size is infinite. However, in reality, the researchers only obtained a limited sample of data. Thus, resulting in less than optimal classification results. In this study, a classification method was applied using Logistics Regression (LR) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Health data that has been used in this study are male fertility data based on lifestyle factors. The purpose of this study was to classify male fertility based on lifestyle and environmental factors as well as evaluate the most influential variables on the classification results with calculation accuracy. The results of the classification accuracy using the LR method was 65 meanwhile, using the SVM method with kernel polinomial accuracy of 95 was obtained. It means SVM method was stable in classifying a small amount of data, from 9 variables only 6 variables that have a significant effect on male fertility clasification were Season, Age, Accident Trauma, High Fever, Alcohol Consumption, Sitting per Day factors"

This development is influenced by several factors, one of which is the determination of the location. PT VWX is a startup company that offers IoT-based products in Indonesia with a target market in 5 islands in Indonesia. There is an assessment of the distribution aspect by operational management, especially on the island of Sumatra which occupies the second level of demand which is still not optimal because the lastmile point warehouse in Sumatra is still experiencing several requests that cannot be fulfilled, so the decision was taken to send directly from the factory. Of the 4 market areas in Sumatra, the focus of this research is the Bengkulu region which occupies the first position and there are problems in shipping as previously described. This is because the existing lastmile warehouse only has a small capacity and in determining the existing location the company does not consider aspects in determining the location of the facility which has an impact on the location of the facility that is not strategic or close to the location of the demand point from time to time. Seeing these problems, the company wants to find a new lastmile point warehouse location that is leased to replace the current warehouse position in the Bengkulu area. In this study, a rental location will be proposed based on the supply chain sustainability aspect to determine the location of facilities, especially warehouses with neutrosophic fuzzy logic using the CRITIC-TOPSIS method. Where this method is one part of multi-criteria decision making in providing subjective and objective weight assessment decisions which will then be ranked using TOPSIS based on the largest weight or y which is closest to the positive ideal solution and furthest from the negative ideal solution. In this study, it was found that the location chosen using the Fuzzy Neutrosophic TOPSIS-CRITIC method by considering 5 criteria for 3 alternative locations based on the assessment of 3 decision makers in the selection of the last mile warehouse location is the location for the warehouse function in Kaur Regency with the final score parameter has the largest relative closeness value.

The results find that financial development and financial institution access have a long-run positive relationship, stable and convergent with household debt. This implies that as the financial system developed, as seen by easy access to financial institutions, this offered some attractive financial instruments and the financial markets became spreads broader, causing household debt to increase because of the easier access to financing and credit facilities matching people???s needs. However, in the short run, financial development and financial institution access do not strongly affect the household debt of countries overall.

What happened in Yogyakarta was a monarchy system that originated from the Islamic Mataram kingdom, which was later recognized as a political institution that held executive power in the democratic system of the Indonesian state. The King of Yogyakarta acts as the holder of executive power (Governor) in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. With the method of literature review and theoretical elaboration, this paper seeks to explore how the history of monarchy in Yogyakarta can collaborate and operate in the democratic system in Indonesia. This paper also looks at and analyze the development of the Yogyakarta Palace and Sultan Hamengku Buwono, who played the role of King and then at the same time held the position of Governor of the Special Region of Yogyakarta. From the analysis, it is found that Yogyakarta is an Islamic kingdom that later joined the Indonesian state as one of the provinces with a special status. The current position of the Special Region of Yogyakarta is a ""prison"" for Sultan Hamengkubuwono. As a King, the Sultan is always supervised by the regional people's representative council in the implementation of regional governance. The King of Yogyakarta, who appears to have dual powers as a King as well as a Governor, is, in fact, nothing more than prisoners imprisoned within the palace walls under the strict supervision of the representative council and the central government"

Indonesian society, which has been under siege by popular culture, has led its people to think popularly. This has created an ideology of popularism and popular imagination which will lead us to think in an instant, profane and superficial. Popular culture is built through production in the mass media industry and marketed for the benefit of consumers. One of them is a television program. Programs that generate high ratings and shares will always be produced. We see that the biggest challenge is how television programs, especially documentaries, can be packaged into something that generates high ratings and shares. Through social semiotics, we argue that the television documentary program ???Indonesia Bagus??? episode ???Potential Natural Resources in Klaten??? presents five things in presenting local cultural values (harmony, respect, cooperation) of the Indonesian nation. The first, program maker sensitivity in perceiving and understanding the uniqueness of a region. Second, presenting the meaning of local culture through historical information. Third, presenting the interaction between shots and maintaining the interaction between elements in the shot to represent reality. Fourth, presenting an objective and subjective camera point of view dynamically to build audience interest in a documentary television program and the fifth, presenting back sound (direct sound or music) to create a harmonious unity scene. The information on local cultural values deserves to be presented as program content by local media as an antidote to the negative effects of popular culture on local culture."

This condition raises hope and has the potential to pose a threat to the vulnerability of media workers, especially journalists. The presence of technology in the production, consumption, and distribution of news causes the work culture to change. Digital technology also reduces the role of journalists, reduces the number of workers while also increasing the burden on workers. This situation triggered the birth of the concept of Platypus Journalism, which is a condition that journalists face when they are required to complete work that was previously borne by several people, but now has to be handled by themselves with the help of digital work tools. Not only that, the digitalization of technology in journalism creates flexibility in space and time. The newsroom becomes limitless as well as the time to work. However, this flexibility holds the potential for exploitation of journalists and increases precariousness. So if allowed to continue, conditions like this have the potential to threaten the sustainability of democracy in Indonesia. Referring to the Political Economy Theory of Labor from Vincent Mosco and the Digital Labor concept from Christian Fuchs and the concept of platypus journalism proposed by Pavlik, this study aims to reveal the implications of changes in digital technology to rise the practice of platypus journalism in Indonesia. In addition, this study tries to examine the position of journalists in the structure of the digital media industry in Indonesia.

Apart from activists, journalists are the most vulnerable targets for doxing. Doxing is an act of tracking and disclosing a person's personal data and identity and then disseminating information to social media so that journalists are cornered and blamed together. Using virtual ethnography and referring to Douglas' doxing concept, this paper tries to describe what doxing is experienced by journalists in Indonesia, especially in the digital world as an implication of their activities. Observations show that doxing aimed at journalists is followed by other forms of cybercrimes such as cyberstalking, cyberharassment, and online impersonation. We conclude that the absence of a legal basis and lack of consistency in law enforcement are important factors in resolving doxing cases against digital journalists in Indonesia.

Using our proposed methodology, we try to answer the following three question in attempt to better understand the characteristics of visiting tourist: where is the most visited area by the tourist? How does their visiting behavior change through the day? And is there any pattern on the movement of tourist between each area? In this study, we attempt to understand those characteristics by utilizing geotagged photos uploaded by tourist on social media. The clustering results from this research show that there is 6 area of interest namely North Kuta, Ubud, South Kuta, Nusa Dua, Sanur, and Tanah Lot where each area of interest have distinct peak visiting time depending on the type of attractions available in that area of interest. The transition matrix from the Markov chain model shows that tourist prefers to stay in the same area of interest, except for one case where a tourist currently at Tanah Lot has a higher probability to moves to North Kuta rather than staying at Tanah Lot. Our result proves that both DBSCAN and markov chain performs considerably well when used to identify and learn about tourist movement behavior."

McDonald's takes advantage of the Korean boy band's worldwide and huge fandom to spread information regarding their products. On the first day of its product launch in Indonesia, Mcdonald's managed to create a long queue of purchases and became a trending topic on many social media. The use of social media enlivens the rapid information dissemination in which Indonesian social media users share their stories about the phenomenon of long queues at their nearest McDonalds. Social media plays an important role in facilitating viral marketing. We present an investigation of the BTS Meal viral marketing mechanism in Indonesia based on a social network analysis approach. Social network analysis is useful to trace and map complex interactions in almost all domains of life. This study discovers the structural evolution of BTS Meal information dissemination in the period of pre-launching, launching, and post-launching phase to understand the viral marketing mechanism and under-stand the behavior of public mass interaction. We successfully discovered that the interaction grew rapidly during the launching period and was slowly being abandoned by the masses. Key actors and topics of the conversation in each phase are unique, dominated by different types of users. McDonald's and the fandom dominated in the pre-launch period, while the news media began to enliven and increasingly shift the position of McDonald's popularity from the launch-ing to the post-launch period.

The emotional side of the user is often used as an approach to understanding and evaluating the needs and wants of the user. Thus the emotional satisfaction of users is a determining factor for the success of a product in the market. This paper proposes the Association Rule Mining (ARM) method to map the emotional side of the user from a product design in which the basic requirements that the user needs and wants can be identified. Using the ""rule mining"" method to evaluate users and product specifications (in the form of a motorcycle as a case example), this study was conducted in three phases: data preprocessing, extracting association rules, and rule evaluation. This approach can be useful for designers and the industry to develop a mass product that can satisfy the emotional side of users so that mass-produced products can be more personally accepted by users."

One technique for assembling bamboo is to unite bamboo using ropes or items with long threads, made from various materials such as coconut fiber, fibers, plastic, etc. some of which are spun (KBBI, 2020). The principle is to use the frictional force between the surface of material that is tied to material of the strap. This study aims to show the behavior of use various materials that are often used in tying bamboo for building construction and recommend the type of fastening connection. The research was conducted by observation and experimental testing to make a bonding model on bamboo and then described it descriptive. The problem that occurs is that over time the construction of buildings from bamboo using tying techniques will experience changes in shape due to loosening of the bonds at the joints which disrupt the stability of the building construction. The cause is the occurrence of expansion or shrinkage of the bamboo stem and its binding tools. From the results of the research conducted, it was found that the binding technique using plant fibers has the advantage of being easier to shape but faster to loosen, the binding technique using plastic has a long durability but is very difficult to tighten, metal ties have advantages of plastic properties but are not able to follow the expansion and shrinkage , fasteners with used rubber tires have good stability and elasticity but low durability.

Recently, due to an increasing demand to solve a semantic segmentation task simultaneously with attribute recognition of objects, a new task named attribute-aware semantic segmentation has been introduced. Since the task requires to handle pixel-wise object class estimation with its attributes such as a pedestrian???s body orientation, previous works had difficulties to handle ambiguous attributes such as body orientations in object-level, especially when segmenting the pedestrians with their attributes correctly. This paper proposes the ColAtt-Net that is an attribute-aware semantic segmentation model augmented by a column-wise mask branch to predict the pedestrians??? orientations in the horizontal perspective of the input image. We firmly assume that the pedestrians captured by a car-mounted camera are distributed horizontally so that for each column of the input image, the pedestrian pixels can be labeled with one orientation uniformly. In the proposed method, we split the output of the base semantic segmentation model into two branches; one branch for segmenting the object categories, while the other one, as the novel column-wise attribute branch, is to map the recognition of pedestrian???s orientations that are distributed horizontally. This method successfully enhances the performance of attribute-aware semantic segmentation by reducing the ambiguity on segmenting the pedestrian???s orientation. Improvements on the pedestrian orientation segmentation are confidently shown by the proposed method in the experimental results, both in quantitative and qualitative views. This paper also discusses how the improved performance becomes an advantage in the autonomous driving system."

Consequently, wireless factory automation has received considerable attention recently. However, most wireless technologies in factory automation have adopted unlicensed bandwidth, which can be affected by interference from other users. Long-term evolution adopts a licensed bandwidth; therefore, it can be a solution for factory automation. This paper presents scheduling algorithms in wireless industrial networks for factory automation in wireless sensor networks using the TD-LTE system. To satisfy real-time requirements, scheduling algorithms based on bio-inspired optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FA), and dynamic frame configuration (DFC) are proposed to cover more nodes. Furthermore, the performances of these algorithms with and without DFC are evaluated."

As a result, some applications on vehicles may turn off and bother the performance of the vehicular systems. In order to escape from this kind of situation, vehicular fog computing is discussed in recent times as an alternative of fog computing support while passing through a blank spot of network infrastructure. However, it is not feasible to establish a trusted vehicular fog computing service among vehicles without mutual trust. To deal with this situation, this paper proposes a method called Bidding-Price-based Trans- action (BPT) for vehicular fog computing service in rural areas. This method is composed of bidding-price-based mutual trust establishment between client vehicle and server vehicle and also payoff assignment based on transaction evaluation. By applying this method, trusted fog computing service transactions between two vehicles can be achieved without the direct assistance of any trusted third party as a validating entity. The simulation results and feasibility analysis then validate the performance of the BPT scheme in rural areas. Based on feasibility analysis, we claim that the BPT scheme can be realized by adjusting vehicle speed and transmission range with respect to the size of offloaded data."

This research aims to study LoRaWAN's deployment for Smart Metering Infrastructure (SMI) in an urban area in Indonesia, namely Bandung city. LoRaWAN uses the unlicensed frequency with a high possibility of interference with similar frequencies. LoRaWAN has limitations in data transmission speeds of 0.3 - 50 kbps. LoRaWAN cannot transmit data directly to the server, so it has to go through a gateway. This research estimates the number of gateways that are required to support SMI device communication. Therefore, this research will analyze and simulate the LoRaWAN network coverage and capacity planning in Bandung city using the simulation software Forsk Atoll. Based on the conducted test, Bandung city is labeled as a city with SF 9 and Code Rate (CR) 4 with Relative Signal Strength Index (RSSI) of -129 dBm.

During the COVID 19 pandemics, almost all activities such as studying and working online. However, several rural areas still did not have internet access due to weak cellular signals. Internet access in rural areas can have various alternatives, such as VSAT (satellite). It needs an inexpensive and precise way to complete the internet access coverage because many customers were concentrated in areas far from the VSAT terminal. WLAN 802.11n was an alternative way to expand the range of internet coverage with low cost and easy implementation. Our case study uses the 5GHz frequency with a sectoral antenna as the multi-hop point-to-point backhaul network's frequency to avoid the risk of channel interference on the backhaul. On the other hand, 2.4GHz frequency with an omnidirectional antenna serves smartphone customers. On the test results, the network latency between multihop access point, has a maximum value of 19,894 ms. This result means that the latency obtained can be categorized as preferred VoIP services based on ITUT G.1010 in the local network. Then for the customer on the fourth hop, 3968 meters from the VSAT terminal, the UDP data rate of 1.04Mbps was stable, and the TCP data rate decreased to 1.26Mbps. This paper emphasizes the use of multihop 5Ghz WLAN 802.11n as a backhaul to expand internet access coverage from VSAT in rural areas, where the concentration of customers was far apart and there were many buffalo horn barriers in traditional homes and buildings."

It can reduce fuel costs and transmission losses in accordance with the generator power composition and location. This paper proposes a method that considers unit commitment in the optimization processes quickly and accurately. It will be considered in determining generator scheduling.

However, most studies evaluate their proposed models by independently separating the datasets between healthy (normal) and unhealthy (abnor-mal/arrhythmia) heart conditions. Some studies even used the ECG signal da-tasets from subjects only under healthy heart conditions. We believe that develop-ing an ECG-based biometric system that includes the heart, both under healthy and unhealthy conditions, is highly needed since the users might be in both con-ditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature, which considers the combination of the dataset of ECG signals from subjects un-der the healthy heart and unhealthy (arrhythmia) conditions in training, validation, and even testing processes. We combined the datasets from MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Ar-rhythmia databases obtained from Physionet. From the combination of those da-tabases, we obtained a total of 32,628 datasets from 89 subjects which were later modeled using a machine learning technique, i.e., one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CONV1D). This study aims to build a light-weight yet reliable ECG-based biometric system by implementing only two layers of the convolu-tional neural network into those joined datasets. We evaluated the model's per-formance with k-fold cross-validation (k 5) and yielded the accuracy and F1-scores of 99.8 And 99.8 respectively. We also proved that our model is a good fitting (not under/over-fitting) by providing the visualization plot of accura-cy and loss. These findings show that our model is robust enough for ECG-based subject identification, which can be implemented for healthy and unhealthy heart conditions."

Therefore, entropy was discovered to be one of the best methods for evaluating the complexity of a biological signal. Recent studies on signal complexity using fractal dimension have been able to tackle the domination of entropy measurement. It was found that Fluctuation-based dispersion entropy (FDispEn) is one of the recently proposed methods based on permutation (PE) and Shannon entropies (SE). This method analyzes the signal???s uncertainty and deals with its fluctuations. FDispEn mainly calculates the differences between adjacent elements of the dispersion patterns based on Shannon entropy, however, it is limited by distance. Therefore, this study proposes a new feature extraction method based on FDispEn by expanding adjacent elements??? measurement distance using the multi-distance signal level differences (MSLD) method. MSLD is an upgrade of the gray-level difference (GLD) that is used to evaluate one-dimensional signals. Furthermore, it is used to calculate several distances of adjacent dispersion patterns. The MSLD is also applied in FDispEn to form multi-distance FDispEn (MFDispEn). Other signal complexity evaluations involving two fractal dimension methods, namely Higuchi and Katz???s were used in forming the multi-distance fluctuation-based dispersion fractal (MFDF). The performance of FDispEn, MFDispEn, and three variations of MFDF were compared to evaluate the epileptic EEG signals. The results showed that the multi-distance application on MFDispEn and MFDF produced a better separability than FDispEn. Meanwhile, the MFDF outperformed the FDispEn and MFDispEn as it showed a higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying epileptic EEG signals."

The connectivity of each brain region can be quantified by EEG coherence, which measures the statistical correlation between electrodes spatially separated on the scalp. Previous studies conducted a coherence analysis of all EEG electrodes covering all parts of the brain. However, in an epileptic condition, seizures occur in a specific region of the brain then spreading to other areas. Therefore, this study applies an energy-based channel selection process to determine the coherence analysis in the most active brain regions during the seizure. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of inter and intrahemispheric coherence in epileptic EEG signals and the correlation with the channel activity to glean insights about brain area connectivity changes during epileptic seizures. Methods: The EEG signals are obtained from ten patients' data from the CHB-MIT dataset. Pair- wise electrode spectral coherence is calculated in the full band and five sub-bands of EEG signals. The channel activity level is determined by calculating the energy of each channel in all patients. Result: The EEG coherence observation in the pre-ictal ( Cohpre ) and ictal ( Cohictal ) conditions showed a significant decrease of Cohictal in the most active channel, especially in the lower EEG sub-bands. This finding indicates that there is a strong correlation between the decrease of mean spectral coherence and channel activity. Conclusions: The decrease of coherence in epileptic conditions ( Cohictal < Cohpre ) indicates low neuronal connectivity. There are some exceptions in some channel pairs, but a constant pattern is found in the high activity channel. This shows a strong correlation between the decrease of coherence and the channel activity. The finding in this study demonstrates that the neuronal connectivity of epileptic EEG signals is suitable to be analyzed in the more active brain regions.

In this study, we assess the use of Ge to enhance the sintering and mechanical properties of a Ti-7Fe based powder metallurgy alloy (Ge??? ???0, 2, and 4 wt. ). Germanium is an ??-stabilising element with good solubility in the Ti matrix and possesses better biocompatibility than the commonly used aluminium ??-stabiliser. After sintering, all alloys exhibited dual-phase microstructures (?? and ?? phase), while an intermetallic Ti5Ge3 also formed in Ti-7Fe-4Ge. Despite being an ??-stabilising element, germanium primarily segregated to the ?? phase regions in the Ti-7Fe-xGe alloys. Gradual increments of the sintered density of the alloys were observed with increasing Ge additions. The sintered Ti-7Fe-xGe alloys were solution treated to exploit the metastability of the retained ?? phase. After solution treatment at 1000??C, the alloys predominantly exhibited ?? phase with minor traces of martensitic athermal ??-phase. Germanium suppressed the formation of the athermal ??-phase and reduced the stability of the ?? phase. The solution-treated Ti-7Fe-2Ge alloy is most promising for implant applications with a relatively low compressive Young's modulus (??? 70 GPa) and high yield strength (??? 1450 MPa), which leads to an outstanding elastic admissible strain of ??? 2.2 ."

Several methods of calibration in the laboratory for microsensors have been introduced, and some field observations under ambient atmosphere, indoor, or personal exposure have been tested. Vast numbers of those sensors can be deployed simultaneously in different locations to get the spatiotemporal resolution of air-quality data in real-time and online. Good agreement between the low-to-medium resolution of particulate sensors and the medium-to-high class of related instruments has been found. Furthermore, low sensitivity of gas sensors can still be sensing the fluctuation of gas concentrations in the air. This means that microsensors can be used to fill the gap of air-quality data for a better understanding of our environment. However, air-quality data from microsensors does not comply with current regulations. Therefore, preparing a good sampling line, as well as the measurement chamber, and avoid direct emissions or humid conditions, will make the air-quality data is still valid (with statistical errors). In this chapter, we discussed the features and trends of microsensors for air-quality measurements and the utilization of these sensors for long-term monitoring of air pollution. Laboratory-checked methods for the sensors and its field observation are discussed along with the technical issues of these sensors."

Photovoltaics have non-linear voltage and current characteristics which influenced by temperature and exposure of solar irradiation so that the maximum power point (MPP) can change at any time. Unfortunately, operating conditions outside the MPP could reduce the efficiency of electrical power transfer from the photovoltaic system to the load. Q-learning (QL) has the potential to provide action decisions of duty cycle signal based on the state of the power gradient percentage range. The Q-learning hybrid method with Type-2 fuzzy logic control is proposed to provide correction of QL control signal by considering the uncertainty direction of power point shifting. The proposed strategy is important particularly to avoid a sudden change in solar irradiation exposure. The simulation results show that the Q-learning hybrid type-2 fuzzy logic control based MPPT response in the photovoltaic control system has tracking efficiency about 97 , rapid rise time of 0,08s, settling time of 0,23s, low overshoot and stable response for handling the change of irradiation and temperature exposure simultaneously."

The problem of battery-less photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis system is the unstable water production due to fluctuating solar radiation. Therefore, this study introduces the concept of seasonal water storage tank in the photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis system to store the water instead of the electricity, resulting in low water cost and stable water supply. Sizing optimization among the main components of this configuration is important to perfectly fulfill the water demand at the lowest water cost. This study developed the algorithms for optimizing the capacities of the components and their capacities combination to obtain the lowest water cost. The reverse osmosis unit capacity was determined based on the designed operating time which was evaluated from 4 to 10 h/d. Two scenarios of water demand, constant and variable, were performed for comparison. The results show that the optimum combinations of component capacity were achieved at designed operating time of RO unit at 8 to 9 h/d. The water costs were very competitive which were 1.74 and 2.59 $/m3 for constant and variable water demand, respectively. Therefore, photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis system with seasonal water storage tank is a promising concept for a stand-alone system."

The recent study shows an effective acquaintance management algorithm by the use of binary risk analysis and greedy-selection-sort based methods. However, the most algorithm does not pay attention to the possibility of the wrong response in a multi-botnet attack. The greedy-based acquaintance management also produces a poor acquaintance selection processing time for a high number of IDS candidates. As the growing advanced of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, it made the acquaintance management potentially end up in an unreliable CIDN acquaintance list which produced low decision accuracy. This paper proposes an acquaintance management algorithm based on multi-class risk-cost analysis and merge-sort selection method. The algorithm implements a merge risk-ordered selection for lower computation complexity. The simulation result has shown the reliability of CIDN as the acquaintance selection processing time is getting lower along with the increased CIDN decision accuracy"

All studies about batch scheduling that are found were in a single flow shop system where all arriving jobs come from single door. In a collaborative flow shop system, every flow shop handles its own customers although joint production among flow shops to improve efficiency is possible. This work aims to develop a novel batch scheduling model for a collaborative multi-product flow shop system. Its objective is to minimize make-span and total production cost. This model is developed by using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) which is proven in many multi objective optimization models. This model is then compared with the non-collaborative models which use NSGA II and adjacent pairwise interchange algorithm. Due to the simulation result, the proposed model performs better than the existing models in minimizing the make-span and total production cost. The make-span of the proposed model is 10 to 17 percent lower than the existing non-collaborative models.

This scheduling system is important due to the nature of the cross-docking system where the arriving products that are carried by the inbound vehicles should be transferred to the outbound vehicles as fast as possible to minimize total completion time and the usage of the temporary storage. Due to its complexity, especially in the cross-docking system with multiproduct characteristics, manual scheduling is almost impossible to achieve its goals. Many studies used several techniques, such as genetic algorithm (GA) and mixed integer programming where these methods are computationally expensive. Some other studies implemented first-in-first-out (FIFO) sequencing in one side and optimization was conducted in another side. Many studies in truck scheduling model in a cross-docking assumed that the temporary storage is unlimited which is in the real world, the temporary storage is limited. Based on this problem, in this work, we propose new truck scheduling model in a cross-docking terminal with limited temporary storage constraint. This model is developed by using multi-agent system. In it, there are three agents: inbound-trucks scheduler agent, outbound-trucks scheduler agent, and material handler agent. The shortest remaining time (SRT) algorithm is adopted in every agent. Based on the simulation result, this proposed model is proven competitive compared with the existing FIFO based models and integer-programming based model. Compared with the integer-programming model, it creates 41.8 percent lower in maximum inventory level. Compared with the FIFO based model, it creates 52.1 to 55.1 percent lower in maximum inventory level. In total time aspect, it creates 0.2 to 2.2 percent lower than the FIFO based model. It creates 7.2 percent higher in total time compared with the integer-programming based model."

Although the lecturer-course assignment problem has been studied widely as part of the education timetabling problem, no existing lecturer-course assignment model suits this circumstance. The new cases in this program are as follows. First, this program is conducted online. Second, the participants are students and lecturers from different universities. Based on this problem, this work proposes a novel lecturer-course assignment model that suits this program. The lecturers' preferred courses and timeslots become hard constraints. The model has three objectives: (1) maximizing the educational quality, (2) maximizing the lecturers' time preference, and (3) minimizing the number of unserved classes. This model is developed by using integer linear programming and optimized by using cloud theory-based simulated annealing. This proposed model is then compared with the four previous lecturers-course assignment models. The first model concerns about minimizing the number of unserved classes, while the second model focuses on maximizing the education quality. The maximum number of classes per course for every lecturer is considered in the third model while balancing the lecturer???s load (teach, research, community service) is the feature of the fourth model. The research concludes that the proposed model is appropriate for lecture-course assignment in Indonesia???s national joint courses program compared to the previous models. Based on the simulation result, the proposed model performs moderately in education quality and several unserved classes. Meanwhile, the proposed model is the best in the timeslot preference aspect by creating a 25 to 28 higher total timeslot score than other previous models."

Unfortunately, research about optimizing intermediate storage is rare. Most existing studies were conducted to minimize or optimize the maximum completion time under various circumstances and constraints. Thus, this work aims to minimize intermediate storage with a tolerable maximum completion time level. In this work, the proposed model was developed by using an evolutionary algorithm (EA). This model consists of two steps. In the first step, the EA is used to determine the tolerable maximum completion time. In the second step, the EA is used to make a solution with minimum intermediate storage and a tolerable maximum completion time.

In this research, we propose a framework for a contextual route recommendation system that is compatible with traffic conditions and vehicle type, along with other relevant attributes (traffic prediction, weather, temperature, humidity, heterogeneity, current speed, and road length). The framework consists of two phases. First, it predicts the traffic conditions by using Knowledge-Growing Bayes Classifier on which the dataset is obtained from crawling the public CCTV feeds and TomTom digital map application for each observed road. The performances of the traffic prediction are around 60.78???73.69 , 63.64???77.39 , and 60.78???73.69 , for accuracy, precision, and recall respectively. Second, to accommodate the route recommendation, we simulate and utilize a new measure, called road capacity value, along with the Dijkstra algorithm. By adopting the compatibility, the simulation results could show alternative paths with the lowest RCV (road capacity value)."

The simulation is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed model compared with the previous models: the zone-based model and the two-step model. The prioritization of the concerned parameters is proven easily adjusted. The simulation result shows that in the over-demand condition, the proposed model creates higher average student national exam score and higher average school-home distance rather than the previous models.

The courses are delivered online in this model, so physical classrooms are no longer required, as was the case in most previous course timetabling studies. In this model, the matching process is conducted based on the assigned timeslots and the requested courses. The courses are elective rather than mandatory. Three metaheuristic methods are used to optimize this model: artificial bee colonies, cloud theory-based simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Due to the simulation process, the cloud theory-based simulated annealing performs best in minimizing the number of unserved requests. This method outperforms the two other metaheuristic methods, the genetic algorithm, and the artificial bee colony algorithm.

Measuring usability helps determine how usable (e.g., effective, efficient, easy to learn) the system from users??? perspective, determine whether any issues need to be fixed, and monitor the performance of the system design over time. The usability evaluation process involved thirteen participants in the first iteration and fifty-six participants in the second iteration.

In the first iteration, the usability score shows that users were often confused by ambiguous words, especially if the words were close together. This study shows that the average usability score of the online prototype analytical tool correlates well with the average SUS score in the second iteration. The usability results obtained were 88 from the online prototype analytical tool and 81.16 from SUS. The score indicates that users were satisfied with the MeMo Tutor application.

Ten SMEs' owner-managers were interviewed and observed in this study. Using qualitative approach, this study attempted to identify the informants' perception on eco-friendly concept, their green initiatives, and barrier of producing eco-batik. Then, the SMEs were categorized based on their green initiatives. From the analysis, it is found that Case 9 seems to be greener than the other nine SMEs. Using natural dye, building wastewater treatment plant, and providing eco-batik trainings were found to be the ecopreneruship practices in batik industry in West Java.

This paper proposes quantum accumulate codes, where idea is coming from the classical accumulate codes that can provide good performances to remove or minimize the error-floor in classic communications. The proposed quantum codes can exactly satisfy both Hamming and Singleton bounds resulting in one of the smallest perfect quantum codes. This paper explains in details the steps to construct the codewords, syndrome extraction, error correction, and the quantum circuits. We perform a series of computer simulations to evaluate the quantum word error rate (QWR) and quantum fidelity performances under the depolarizing channels. Our results confirm that the stabilizers of the proposed codes can extract the syndrome and distinguish all error patterns of any single qubit errors of Pauli X, Y, and Z providing performances confirmed by the theoretical QWER curves. The results are expected to provide contributions to the development of quantum communications and future security issues."

In a series of optimization processes, the degree of curvature and optimum configuration are investigated. The investigation results show that the sensor with an oval patch has better performance on the reflection coefficient. A good agreement on the bandwidth response is achieved between simulation and measurement in the frequency range of 3.06 GHz to 19.51 GHz.

The array is simulated through a single unit cell of square patch implementing appropriate boundaries surrounding the unit cell to form an EM wave absorber pattern of infinite extent. The performance of simulation is analyzed using transmission line model by deriving the input impedance at the border between the vacuum and the square patch. In order to analyze the correlation between the simulation and the proposed transmission line model, physical parameter of square patch corresponding to admittance component is varied to have similar frequency response. Three different widths of square patch are simulated for the analysis producing the frequency response of 11.95 GHz, 11.05 GHz, 9.95 GHz and 9.00 GHz.

But the development of this system by implementing a mesh topology based on the ZigBee protocol still has limitations. When more than one active ECG node sends a data stream, there will be incorrect data or damage due to a failure of synchronization between the user node and the coordinator node. Damaged or incorrect data will negatively affect signal interpretation. Therefore, a mechanism is needed to correct or predict the damaged data. In this study, the method of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Regression Imputation (RI) was proposed to overcome these problems. Real data from previous studies are the main modalities used in this study. The ECG signal data that has been predicted is then compared with the actual ECG data stored in the main controller memory. Root mean square error (RMSE) is calculated to measure system performance. The simulation was performed on 13 ECG waves, each of them has 1000 samples. The simulation results show that the EM method has a lower predictive error value than the RI method. The average RMSE for the EM and RI methods is 4.77 and 6.63, respectively.

The issue raised is how these MSMEs adapt to changes caused by the lockdown rules. The Government limits the mobility of people and the operating hours of various businesses, especially those where people gather, and change prioritize of consumer purchases to groceries. The food stall is affected by the lack of consumer purchases coming to the shop or stall, which means declining sales. Small shop MSMEs such as Pondok Bakso Mataram in Tebing Tinggi, North Sumatra, also experienced a decline in sales. Before the pandemic, they only sold directly at stalls; previously, they did not use online channels. The addition of online channels wants to be understood more comprehensively through the canvas business model framework. Additions or adjustments to the business building blocks are carried out through a descriptive qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews starting from the channel block by adding the marketplace channel. Informants are the staff at the shop as many as four people. The analysis uses a matrix table that shows similarities and differences in information in each business block and then mapped it on the business model canvas framework. The results show that online channels to SME businesses such as Pondok Bakso Mataram can serve more consumers by paying attention to more responsive communication services, maintaining good food taste quality, and promoting price discounts. These findings can be important for another similar MSME to help them understand a business model using online platforms as new channels to survive and grow in this pandemic situation."

This sound has a specific character if there is a disease in the lungs. In some cases, it is difficult to distinguish one type of lung sound to another. It takes the expertise, experience and sensitivity of clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis. Therefore, many studies have proposed a feature extraction method combined with automatic classification method for the detection of lung disease through lung sound analysis. Since the complex nature of biological signals which are produced by complex processes, the multiscale method is an interesting feature extraction method to be developed. This study proposes an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a modified gray level difference (GLD) for a lung sound classification. The EMD was used to decompose the signal, and then GLD was measured on each decomposed signal as a feature set. There are five classes of lung sounds which were simulated in this study, including normal, wheeze, crackle, pleural rub, and stridor. Performance evaluation was carried out using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 3-fold cross-validation. This proposed method yielded the highest accuracy of 96.97 . This study outperformed several previous studies which were simulated on the same dataset.

The minimum power of electromagnetic wave radiation is also needed to avoid unsafe usability in patients??? respiration monitoring. To attain low power operation and efficient frequency spectrum usage, the Multi-Frequency Continuous Wave (MFCW) radar system is proposed in this paper as a non-contact sensor for human respiration. The simulation study and laboratory experiment of the multi-frequency continuous wave radar system in detecting human respiration were performed, and the comparison study with Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Radar (FMCW) was discussed in this paper. The simulation shows that the Effective Isotropic Radiation Power (EIRP) of MFCW is 9 dBm lower than FMCW at a 2 m measurement distance. The result also demonstrates that the proposed MFCW performs well under amplitude and phase noise. The laboratory experiments were conducted by implementing the proposed system using the Software Defined Radio Device. The experiment results also confirm that the proposed MFCW was able to reduce the EIRP and spectrum occupation compared to the FMCW. The MFCW system is then recommended as a radar system in developing a non-contact sensor for respiration monitoring in healthcare."

Therefore, we developed a method to improve the message exchange mechanism and reduce the message resources burden in sending synchronization message information between con- trollers. This study proposes using asynchronous messages as distributed SDN controller message exchanges with the 3-in-1 method, which is the mechanism carried out by sending three messages and producing a reply in one acknowledgment. Our experiments show that the 3-in-1 method gives lower CPU and memory usage and has a higher throughput than the traditional message exchange in Distributed SDN Controller."

While the general studies assume uniform setup time for tool switching, applications on the industries indicate that the setup time of a tool might depend on the previously installed tool of the same slot. Therefore, this article proposes two integer linear programming models for the sequence-dependent SSP, namely the five-index formulation and the multicommodity flow formulation. Experimental tests are executed to compare the sequence-dependent SSP with the uniform SSP and the results show the effectiveness of multicommodity flow formulation.

In addition, there are growing issues of availability, scalability, and functionality of applications that will lead to dead code. Microservices architectural pattern emerges as an alternative. However, the service decomposition process and data management on services in microservice applications require special attention. Based on the issues described above, in this study, the microservices architecture paradigm with a domain-driven design (DDD) approach is applied to develop an IoT Monitoring application that can handle various IoT projects on one platform. The results show that a definition of a service is designed to be more accurate. The application of the DDD concept in breaking down application services helps in mapping each domain. Therefore, it can produce adaptive software products and generate easy-tomaintain code. The microservice architecture with a REST APIbased approach applied to the IoT monitoring application has worked well, tested at the unit testing, integration, and performance stages. Based on performance testing results, the number of nodes (with three sensors per node) that can access simultaneously reaches 75 nodes. The total sensors in one node can have up to 10 sensors per node with a response time of less than 100ms. System development can be done without overhauling the entire system and does not interfere with the performance of other services."

This task is essential because, from the morphological aspect of a word, it can know the different forms of a word, and from that, it can know its meaning. The Gonzales paper has successfully created a model to identify morphological features (MSD) of Arabic word verb only. This study will focus on adding some other Arabic type of word, which is a noun. Trying to use the current state-of-the-art approach method is neural-based with the recurrent neural network (RNN). RNN can capture more information about the sequence of sub-word like prefix, infix, root, and suffix to make a better msd identifier. The input is a single Arabic word Going through pattern extraction, sub word vectorizing, verb form identification, pronoun and type of word identification, and finally MSD identification process to see the result. This study helps to improve the last gap (morphological analyzer on POS noun) and enhances what can be identified from the previous approach to perform better. This model successfully identifies MSD with 99 accuracy and 97 F1 - score.

This paper discusses the pedestrian flow simulation using a macroscopic model with the Lax-Wendroff scheme. In this simulation, velocity function is generated by polynomial regression method from observation data. This velocity function is the relationship between average velocity and pedestrian density over fixed domain. In this research, density and velocity pedestrian data are obtained from direct observation on Jalan Lampulo, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Here, two best polynomial functions are obtained as velocity functions, i.e., quadratic function z_2 and polynomial function of degree six (z_6). The simulation results show that at final time T 2 seconds and T 4 seconds, the position of pedestrian using the velocity function z_6 is approximately 0.6 meters in front of the pedestrian with velocity function z_2. A pedestrian using velocity function z_6 is approximately 1 meter in front of the pedestrian with velocity function z_2 at final time T 6 seconds. The simulation continues until at final time T 8 seconds, the position of pedestrian using the velocity function z_6 is approximately 1.2 meters in front of the pedestrian with velocity function z_2. The density of z_6 lower than z_2, this is due to the higher velocity of z_6 which causes pedestrians move faster. Based on numerical simulations, it shows that pedestrian with velocity function z_6 is faster than with velocity function z_2. Moreover, the linearity of coefficients of the polynomial functions is analyzed using hypothesis testing in this research."

With IMDb site reviews being unstructured and bias-heavy, classification methods by reducing additional sentiment bias is needed to create a balanced classification with lower polarity bias. Elimination of additional sentiment bias will improve the model as polarity is defined by non-bias method, resulting in models correctly defined which sequences of words is either positive or negative. This research limits the dataset by 50.000 rows of randomly extracted reviews from the IMDb website using dataset preparation methods such as Preprocessing, POS-Tagging, and Word Embeddings. Then preprocessed data is used in classification methods such as ANN, SWN, and SO-Cal. This paper also used bias processing methods such as Hyperparameter Tuning and BPM, with outputs evaluated using Accuracy and PBR metrics. This research yields 77.39 for ANN, 66.32 for BPM, 75.6 for SO-Cal, and 76.26 for Hybrid classification. Best PBR resulted in two lexicon-based methods on 0.0009 for BPM, and 0.00006 for SO-Cal.

Apakah penggunaan isu tersebut memang ingin menunjukkan keperdulian dari merek terhadap khalayak sebagai konsumen ataukah memang demi kepentingan penjualan saja? Dari rumusan masalah tersebut, penelitian ini menggunakan purposive sampling yaitu menganalisis beberapa iklan produk yang menggunakan isu pandemi covid-19 dengan metode kualitatif dimana iklan akan di kaji dengan menggunakan analisis konten untuk mengetahui bagaimana pendekatan komunikasi dan visualnya, lalu akan dibahas dengan pendekatan teori strategi kreatif dalam iklan. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui seperti apa pola strategi kreatif yang digunakan dan tentu saja untuk menjawab kepentingan apa yang terdapat pada pola strategi kreatif tersebut berdasarkan rumusan masalah yang telah disebutkan. Hasil penelitian tidak menunjukkan adanya kepentingan penjualan semata pada kategori yang menayangkan secara jelas tentang virus corona berdasarkan pengkajian pesan iklan.

It is very important in development and construction, especially infrastructure. Data from the Indo-nesian Cement Association shows that cement consumption in 2018 reached around 70 million tons. The growth rate reached 8 over the past 5 years. It is predicted that in 2019 the demand will reach 75 million tons. Even though the cement industry has considerable potential, the Stock Price Index has fluctuated in the last 5 years. In addition, the return value of the shares also fluctuates. So, it is necessary to further analyze the company???s valuation before investing to minimize the risk. Therefore, before deciding to invest in a stock, it is strongly recommend-ed that an investor conduct a stock valuation analysis in advance to find out the intrinsic value of the stock."

This research uses a qualitative case study approach using the QDA Miner 5 tool for data processing, with triangulation techniques. Literature review and interviews were conducted to obtain answers to research questions. An important finding of this study is that laws and regulations regarding the practice of CPAs and Accounting Firms in Indonesia are considered to be more favorable to large, internationally affiliated accounting firms, which already have a competitive advantage over local accounting firms. A number of obligations that must be paid by CPAs and local accounting firms become obstacles that are difficult to overcome because of limited work and finances. There is potential, accounting graduates in Indonesia are not interested in becoming a CPA and working in an accounting firm because the cost to get a CPA certification is expensive and difficult to achieve, the annual fee for a CPA is expensive, but the salary earned is low."

Many industries are experiencing a slowdown in growth. Earnings information is the responsibility of management. On the one hand, earnings information is able to help company owners and company external parties to assess company performance. On the other hand, earnings information is often the target of engineering through opportunistic management actions so that this encourages the emergence of actions to regulate earnings or often referred to as earnings management. Earnings management is an action taken by management to increase or decrease the earnings reported by the company. This study examines the factors that influence earnings management, namely corporate social responsibility, debt covenant, and audit committee of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period of 2020. The samples of this study consisted of 80 companies taken with purposive sampling technique. The novelty of this study was corporate social responsibility with the financial services authority???s criteria. The study findings showed that corporate social responsibility was a determinant of earnings management, unlike audit committee and debt covenant. This study provides theoretical implications that the higher the disclosure of corporate social responsibility, the higher the opportunistic actions taken by management. The results of this study provide an empirical contribution to the earnings management literature, namely in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, many manufacturing companies have income decreasing. This research contributes to the practice, namely for investors. Investors are expected to evaluate the company's financial and non-financial performance before making investment decisions.

However, the exchange rate of Bitcoin against any foreign currency is considered to have high volatility making it difficult to determine the real value of Bitcoin. The main purpose of this research is to find the value of Bitcoin, especially US Dollar and Rupiah currencies. The test is carried out using the weak market efficiency hypothesis and the semi-form market coefficient hypothesis. The data processing methods are used the stationary test (ADF, KPSS, and ERS) to test the efficiency of the weak form market and the cointegration test (Johansen Cointegration) with the VECM model to check the efficiency of the semi-strong market. The results show that the Bitcoin exchange rate does not have a unit root so it is inefficient in a weak form and has a negative effect on the USD / IDR exchange rate so that it is not efficient in semi-strong form as well as on the US Dollar and Rupiah exchange rates. This happens because Bitcoin transactions as a medium of exchange in Indonesia are still illegal. So that the Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar and Rupiah exchange rates is biased because it does not reflect the available information, both historical information and public information.

Melalui kajian ini, penulis mencoba menginterpretasikan dan melakukan penggalian nilai-nilai spritualitas pada beberapa karya Tisna Sanjaya dengan menggunakan pendekatan teori utama filsafat Islam dan estetika Islam dibantu dengan metode Kritik Seni untuk pembacaan karya seni. Dua karya yang dikaji yaitu karya yang berjudul ???Tubuh 5 Waktu??? dan ???Air Suci Cihampelas???. Dua karya tersebut dalam catatan penulis, telah dipamerkan dalam pameran seni rupa Islam Kontemporer Indonesia sekitar 10 tahun yang lalu. Temuan-temuan dari kajian ini sifatnya interpretatif. Penafsiran yang dilakukan penulis tentunya bukan tafsiran yang kosong tetapi tafsiran dengan mengutamakan landasan teori utama. Spiritualitas sebagaimana yang dikatakan Profesor Setiawan Sabana memiliki dua jenis. Jenis yang pertama spiritualitas religious dan yang kedua spiritualitas sekuler. Spiritualitas religious adalah spiritualitas dengan sandaran refensi-referensi yang berkaitan dengan keyakinan agama yang dianut seseorang, sedangkan spiritualitas sekuler kebalikannya. Pada kajian ini, penulis dengan detail mendeskripsikan masing-masing karya Tisna Sanjaya lalu menganalisis sampai dengan menyimpulkan dengan metode kritik seni. Kesimpulan kuat penulis tentang spiritulitas karya-karya Tisna Sanjaya adalah spiritulitas religious dengan bukti-bukti yang dianalisis pada pembahasan kajian ini. Semoga kajian ini menjadi salah satu kajian tentang seni rupa Islam di Indonesia dalam menjaga existensinya baik dalam lapangan kajian maupun lapangan praktek.

From the results of the gradation contour test results, there is linearity between the results of accuracy with the large number of images tested. Therefore, it can be said that the influence of the number of images will affect the accuracy of classification. The use of contour gradation can be accepted and treated equally in all image types, so there is no more differentiation between image features. The complexity of the image does not affect the method of extracting features that are only used uniquely by an image.

However, it has less embedding capacity and it raises suspicion. For overcoming the problem, bitwise operation is proposed. In the proposed method, the message was embedded into the cover by converting the message and the cover into binary representation based on a mapping table that was already known by the sender and the receiver. Furthermore, XOR bitwise operations were applied to the secret message and cover bits based on random numbers that were generated using a modular function. Moreover, the result was converted into characters that represent the secret message bits. After embedding the message into the cover, an email alias was generated to camouflage the secret message characters. Finally, the sender sends the embedded cover and the email alias to the recipient. Using the proposed method, the embedding capacity is 89 larger than using the original Headstega. For reducing the adversary???s suspicion, the existing email address was used instead of creating a new email address."

However, based on Jung et al. analysis 2015[2], Lee???s scheme has several weaknesses against impersonation and off-line password guessing attack. Moreover, the scheme is also failed to preserve user anonymity. This research proposed an improvement scheme to strengthen Lee???s scheme[1]. For strengthening Lee???s scheme, the proposed scheme uses Zero Knowledge and keyed hash function. The proposed scheme introduces additional phase for generating a session key for securing the communication between two parties each other. Based on the experiment, it can be concluded that the proposed scheme is stronger than the previous scheme because the probability for breaking the proposed scheme using off-line password guessing and impersonation attack is less than probability for breaking Lee???s scheme."

Recently, computers can automatically recognize them using digital image processing technologies, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, a CNN-based classification model of apple types is developed using 1,856 apple images from three classes derived from the fruit-360 dataset on the Kaggle website, and its robustness is then examined. An examination based on 5-fold cross-validation shows that CNN is robust to decreasing the portion of training set size up to 50 to get high accuracy of 99.97 in classifying 50 testing set, which is better than previous models that use VGG16, faster R-CNN, and Tanh. Decreasing the portion training set to 40 and 30 reduces the accuracy to 95.97 and 95.29 , respectively.

Swarm UAVs, however, need to plan paths through the atmosphere, effectively preventing any collision that can occur when flying a multiple UAV simultaneously. This study proposes to produce the shortest route to the destination point while avoiding collisions between UAVs by using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The ABC algorithm is an optimization method inspired by the foraging behavior of honeybees. Inside their colonies, they have a specific role for their labor, such as employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The self-organization trait in honeybees enables them to coordinate themselves to create a global and local optimum. The proposed system uses the ABC algorithm to optimize UAV's velocity to reach its destination efficiently in the shortest path while avoiding collision between each drone in the vicinity. This is possible by minimizing the objective function along with its constraint. The result shows a successful simulation of swarm UAV with a random initial position that travels towards a predetermined goal position using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to optimize the velocity of each drone. To avoid a collision, establishing a constraint of the minimum acceptable distance between UAVs enables the algorithm to search for an alternative path to avoid the collision. Once swarm UAV reaches its destination and is at rest, the cluster will not overlap or collide with each other agent."

The experiments performed in this study were one-dimensional (1-D) represented by falling motion and two-dimensional (2-D) using parabolic motion. In evaluating the experimental results, the obtained data were compared to the theoretical values that were calculated using analytical approach. The use of this method shows great measurement results in showing dependency of falling motion due to gravitational acceleration and proofing the constant velocity at projectile motion on its horizontal plane in which it is comparable to the theoretical value. The video analyzation method also can be used as an alternative solution to the established software, even better when the higher resolution camera and frame rate were used. Noting that the tools used in the experiment were common around, thus, this can be used as a replacement for the advance tools."

There are several important points that became the result of the FGD, including (1) physics logic must be made simpler that is easy to understand (2) Mathematical formula which becomes a symbol language does not need to be introduced first. Language skills are needed to understand physics and communicate it (3) Through the right approach, method and media, learning that is delivered by the teacher will make early childhood more literate with physics.This research concludes that physics is possible to be taught in early childhood. We, therefore, recommend that early childhood teachers collaborate with physics teachers in planning, implementing, and evaluating physics learning"

In this study, the effect of noise-based augmentation on the performance of deep learning based classification will be studied. The noises which were used for the augmentation method were Perlin-noise and Gaussian noise. The modality of medical image used in this study is X-ray. 174 X-ray images (87 cancer, 87 normal) were used in this study and will be classified by using transfer learning from previously trained deep learning architecture. The deep learning architecture used was vgg-19. The images were divided into two groups, 138 (69 cancer, 69 normal) images were used for training phase and 36 (18 cancer, 18 normal) were images used for testing phase. Three deep learning models were used for the classification tasks, the first one was retrained to classify the original images, the second one was retrained by using mix of original images and images with Perlin-noise, and the third one was retrained by using mix of original images and images with Gaussian noise.

There are three common models that are used in online taxi dispatch system: (1) first come first served, (2) stable marriage, and (3) agent-based models. Unfortunately, these existing models accommodate passenger???s waiting time and/or driver???s pickup cost only. Meanwhile, there are several other important aspects: price, driver???s service level, and passenger???s behaviour. Based on this problem, this work aims to develop a dispatching model for online taxi system that accommodates these aspects too rather than waiting time and pickup cost only. This model is developed by combining stable marriage and first price sealed bid auction. The stable marriage is used to satisfy both passenger and driver. The first price sealed bid auction is used to offer a competitive price for the passenger that is still accepted by the driver. Based on the simulation result, overall, the proposed model performs the best among the previous models, except in the average pickup distance. In the extreme undersupply condition, the proposed model creates 20 percent higher in the average customer???s satisfaction score and equal in the average net distance. In the extreme oversupply condition, the proposed model creates 28 percent higher in the vehicle???s satisfaction score. The proposed model creates up to 21 percent lower travel cost. Although the proposed model creates the worst in the average pickup distance, the average pickup time is 3.9 minutes with the assumption that the vehicle???s speed is 10 km per hour."

It makes the vendor becomes a dominant entity, and customers are supplied by its own vendor exclusively. That is why most studies in VMI implement a single-vendor-single-customer or single-vendor-multi-customer scenario. In certain conditions, this exclusiveness can increase lost sales. Besides, most of them implement a single product scenario. In this work, we develop VMI model for the multi-vendor-customer-product scenario. This model is developed based on the collaborative multi-agent system. The relationship between vendors and customers is many-to-many. This work aims to reduce lost sales and maintain efficiency in the inventory. The continuous review (r, Q) policy is used as the replenishment model. The simulation result shows that the collaborative model creates higher sales, lower lost sales, and competitive inventory than the non-collaborative one. The lost sales is 50 to 75 percent lower. The sales percentage is 17 to 27 percent higher. The total retailers??? stock is 20 to 38 percent higher. The total vendors??? stock is 11 to 30 percent lower. The total stock in the supply chain in the collaborative model is 2 to 16 percent higher.

Every flow-shop acts as an independent entity, but there is a collaboration among them. Although the relation between flow-shops and their customers is exclusive, collaboration through production sharing is possible. This circumstance is different from most studies in flow-shop scheduling problems (FSP), for example, parallel or distributed, where all jobs come from a single point and are then distributed to the production resources. In the multiple independent flow-shops, each flow-shop has its own processing time and production cost. Through collaboration, efficiency can be achieved in the make-span and total cost aspects, which becomes the objective of this work. This model is developed by combining the first price sealed bid auction and cloud theory-based simulated annealing. The first price sealed bid auction is conducted to minimize the total production cost. Meanwhile, the cloud theory-based simulated annealing is conducted to minimize the make-span. This model is then compared with the existing non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) based flow-shop scheduling models. The first existing model is a parallel flow-shop, while the second one is a collaborative flow-shop. The simulation result shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing models in the total cost aspect.

Many studies in it focused on minimizing cost and distance with assumption that all nodes are visited. Ironically, number of unserved customers (nodes) in a single trip was rarely explored and often ignored. Based on this problem, this work aims to minimize the total travel distance and the number of unserved customers in single routing cycle. The solution is developed by combining the stable marriage algorithm and k-means clustering in the clustering process. The nearest neighbour algorithm is used in the routing process. This work proposes two contributions. The first is the usage of the stable marriage and k-means clustering. The second is concerning the predetermined distribution of the vehicles in the solution to reduce the number of unserved customers. In the simulation, this proposed model is compared with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA), partition-based algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (PBA-NN), genetic algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (GA-NN) and simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Based on the simulation result, it is found that the proposed model performs moderately as a trade-off between the HEA and PBA-NN. In the number of unserved customers aspect, when the number of customers is low, the proposed model creates 71 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high, the proposed model creates 73 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. In the total travel distance aspect, when the number of customers is low (50 persons), the proposed model creates 63 percent higher than the GA-NN model and 48 percent lower than the SA model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high (100 customers), the proposed model creates 52 percent higher than the PBA-NN model and 54 percent lower than the SA model."

Software testing is one of the important phases in determining software quality. In the software development cycle, the testing phase takes more than 50 of the development time. The process of creating test cases in software testing is the most difficult process and determines the success of the testing phase. Test cases for software testing can be created based on the existing analytical modeling in the software specifications. This kind of testing technique is known as model-based testing, which is one of the black box testing approaches. In this study, the analytical model used is the UML Activity diagram. The reason for choosing UML Activity diagrams is because this diagram can model activities in software based on behaviors and conditions that are by the sequence. The output of this research is a prototype of a test case generator using an activity diagram. The analysis of the suitability of the test cases generated for the Digi-OTA application using the equivalence partitioning method is 100 when tested with valid data test specifications, while when tested with invalid test data specifications it produces 100 for approving actors, 95.98 for employee actors and 95.45 for detail officer actor.

The quantitative approach used to partially determine the relationship between variables is using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) while for simultaneous data analysis is using IBM SPSS Statistics. The results of quantitative analysis with SEM-PLS shows that the results of the hypothesis test are that the workload variable has a negative significant effect on loyalty, the work environment variable has a positive significant effect on loyalty and the training variable has a positive significant effect on loyalty. The results of data analysis with IBM SPSS Statistics show that the variables of workload, work environment and training simultaneously also have a significant effect on loyalty. The results of this study are expected to be used as an evaluation to pay more attention to the proportion of workload, working environment conditions and the proportion of training for operators which are proven that these three variables can affect the operator's level of loyalty to his work."

Various invasive and noninvasive methods to monitor the condition of the WBCs have been developed. Among them, a noninvasive method exploits an optical characteristic of WBCs in a nailfold capillary image, as they appear as visual gaps. This method is inexpensive and could possibly be implemented on a portable device. However, recent studies on this method use a manual or semimanual image segmentation, which depends on recognizable features and the intervention of experts, hindering its scalability and applicability. We address and solve this problem with proposing an automated method for detecting and counting WBCs that appear as visual gaps on nailfold capillary images. The proposed method consists of an automatic capillary segmentation method using deep learning, video stabilization, and WBC event detection algorithms. Performances of the three segmentation algorithms (manual, conventional, and deep learning) with/without video stabilization were benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of the WBC event counting and outperforms conventional approaches."

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Early detection followed by therapy is one of the efforts to reduce the mortality rate of this disease. One of the leading medical instruments for diagnosing heart disorders is the electrocardiogram (ECG). The shape of the ECG signal represents normal or abnormal heart conditions. Some of the most common heart defects are atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block. Detection or classification can be difficult if performed visually. Therefore in this study, we propose a method for the automatic classification of ECG signals. This method generally consists of feature extraction and classification. The feature extraction used is based on information theory, namely Fuzzy entropy and Shannon entropy, which is calculated on the decomposed signal. The simulated ECG signals are of three types: normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and left bundle branch block. Support vector machine and k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms were employed for the validation performance of the proposed method. From the test results obtained, the highest accuracy is 81.1 . With specificity and sensitivity of 79.4 and 89.8 , respectively. It is hoped that this proposed method can be further developed to assist clinical diagnosis.

Apart from its small size, the microstrip antenna can generate multiple frequency response which is more cost effective due to its suitability for several applications which have appropriate frequency specifications. In this paper, an AMC-based tunable multi-band microstrip antenna is designed by incorporating external components, namely varactor diode, into the AMC structure. The incorporation of varactor diodes with varied reverse DC bias voltages can affect the capacitance value on the antenna. Two layers of 1.6 mm thick FR4 Epoxy dielectric substrate are used for designing the antenna with the dimension of 51 mm ?? 51 mm ?? 3.2 mm. The characterization results show that the proposed microstrip antenna could produce tunable multi-band frequency response in the frequency range of 1.575 GHz to 2.595 GHz along with the reverse DC bias voltage variation. The higher the applied reverse DC bias voltage across the varactor diode, the smaller the capacitance value yielding the higher the resonant frequency.

One of the most featured areas in this mall is the Resort Level area because it has an atmosphere as if visitors feel in the open. The resort level located in the Paris Van Java mall has a long corridor with retail store facilities on the right and left. The resort level at the Paris Van Java mall has its own uniqueness because of the towering retail facade, making it look like a two-story building. However, problems arise related to the dimensions of the towering facade, namely the limited ability of consumers to see the overall design on the retail facade. The limited ability of consumers related to anthropometry is influenced by several environmental factors around the resort level. Some of these environmental factors include the dimensions of the corridor related to human visibility, the presence of retail merchandising units (RMU) in the corridor area, the density of visitors in the corridor, and the presence of decorations or displays in the resort level corridor area. This study uses a qualitative descriptive analysis method to determine the extent to which the effectiveness of the design on the facade of the retail store on the visual ability of consumers. Significant results were obtained that the facade design of retail stores in the Resort Level area could not be seen and felt optimally by visitors due to anthropometric and environmental factorsThe continuation of this research is expected to be the right reference as the basis for designing the facade design inside the mall to be more effective."

The four quality criteria, i.e. fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity, should be well balanced in order to produce proper process models which are aligned to the real-life behavior of these processes executions. This paper proposes a method to optimize process discovery quality criteria (PDQC) by implementing different thresholds and analyzing calculation results using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm. This paper sets up two experiments with different scenarios to measure the calculations of quality criteria and the quality of generated models. The experiments compare two SOPs to the process models discovered by Infrequent Inductive Miner algorithm; hence the SOPs serve as references to determine the generated models quality. As follow ups, two synthetic event logs were created in reference to the SOPs in conducting the experiments. The purpose of applying two different scenarios in the experiments is to discover how well the Infrequent Inductive Miner thresholds can produce predictive models under these two different scenarios circumstances. This paper has been successful in predicting the best-fit model in reference to the SOPs by optimizing the four quality criteria of process discovery using ROC thresholds settings and by using infrequent inductive miner algorithm for models generation, and also in improving the accuracy of models measurements."

Measurements were carried out at DISKOMINFO Majalengka District as a representative of government units. The results of the E-Readiness survey stated that the readiness level reached 45 and the ICT maturity level reached 2.86 (managed level). Overall DISKOMINFO has shortcomings in various aspects assessed through the COBIT 5 standard. Meanwhile, based on the Pearson Correlation, a correlation value of 0.92 is obtained.

One of the biggest problems is determining the process model. The existing requirements analysis method is not good enough in producing process model. There are many invalid process models, although they have gone through a series of observations on users. To deal with this, a 'soft' or human-centered method is therefore required. Problems are seen and determined from the point of view of the people involved in the problems. One method that can be used to solve problems is the Design Thinking approach. Design Thinking is the process of creating new ideas and innovative approaches that can solve user problems. This paper proposes the use of an alternative Design Thinking approach in conducting a requirements analysis on the development of Trash Bank system with an interactive qualitative approach. The approach taken is to integrate the concept of Design Thinking in the requirements analysis stage. Through collaboration model the Design Thinking to Requirements analysis, the resulting process model is more valid because the process of exploring the requirements becomes deeper, which is based on user experience. The exploration of user experience from Collaboration model will become the basis for process modeling. According to the approach taken, a more humane and more explored prototype of the system flow is obtained from the human attitude that is involved in the process."

The traditional method for determining rice quality is to utilize human senses to detect the aroma of rice and examine the texture of the rice. In this paper, we use electronic nose data to predict rice quality using the Na??ve Bayes classifier methods; Gaussian, Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Complement. Among these four methods, Multinomial obtains an accuracy of 97 , Complement obtains an accuracy of 98 , and Gaussian obtains an accuracy of 82 , these methods showed a high ROC value of 1.00, indicating perfect classification. With a ROC value of 0.54, the Bernoulli method exhibited the least performance in classifying the rice quality by obtaining an accuracy of 52 .

However, it does not give satisfactory results. Most of the problem is based on piezoelectric material problems that are not compatible with converting noise energy to electricity. Another problem is the capacity of primary energy is not enough to be converted. Thus, the idea of combining the noise energy with others is proposing a solution to overcome the problem of primary energy capacity. It may give good energy harvesting results. In the proposed research, two scenarios were running. The first scenario combines the noise energy with footing pressure energy with resulting voltage and current values charged to the 10 ??F capacitor when 60 seconds are 11.49 V and 6.60 mA. Meanwhile, the second scenario combines the noise energy with both footing pressure energy and wind energy, simultaneously. The result in the second scenario is the voltage and current values charged to the 10 ??F capacitor when 60 seconds are 11.89 V and 6.82 mA. All scenarios show significant current and voltage at measurement in capacitors. However, the current and voltage that is produced by both scenarios shows no significant differences. Even though the second scenario give a slightly high current than the first scenario, combining noise energy and two other energy resources is relatively promising for the next development. It will be essential to develop this energy harvesting for low demand in industrial parks appliances such as streetlamps. Keywords???

Non-contact monitoring processes will provide an advantage in covering a large area operation. The radar system is potentially applied as a noncontact sensor. However, small displacement detection requires high resolution referring the range resolution perspective. Detecting a small displacement on a millimeter to centimeter scale requires a very wide bandwidth. The main information to be obtained from small displacement detection is the distance of the target and the size of the small displacement. Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (FMCW) is a radar system that has been widely used in various fields. In this paper, a small displacement detection method is proposed by developing the detection capabilities of the FMCW radar. The ability to detect distance using beat frequency identification is maintained and phase detection is elaborated to detect small displacement without having to increase bandwidth. The experimental modeling of proposed FMCW using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) was conducted in this study. The results show that the proposed FMCW system using VNA has the ability to detect small displacement with average phase shift of 0.41 radians for a 2 mm shift in the direction close to the target and 0.44 radians for the direction away from the target."

Careful analyses of short term wind speed prediction at different heights and future hours show that wind speed is predicted more accurately at higher heights. For example, the mean absolute percent error decreases from 0.25 to 0.12 corresponding to heights 10 to 300m, respectively for the 6th future hour prediction, an improvement of around 50 .

Docker requires docker daemon to build, distribute and run the container and this makes the docker vulnerable to an attack surface called Docker daemon Attack Surface - an attack against docker daemon taking over the access (root). Using rootless mode is one way to prevent the attack. Therefore, this research demonstrates the attack prevention by making and running the docker container in the rootless mode. The success of the attack can be proven when the user is able to access the file /etc/shadow that is supposed to be only accessible for the rooted users. Findings of this research demonstrated that the file is inaccessible when the docker is run using the rootless mode. CPU usage is measured when the attack is being simulated using the docker run through root privileges and rootless mode, to identify whether the use of rootless mode in the docker adds the load of CPU usage and to what extent its increased. Results showed that the CPU use was 39 when using the docker with the rootless mode. Meanwhile, using the docker with the right of the root access was only 0 . The increase of 39 is commensurate with the benefit that can prevent the docker daemon attack surface."

The basic features for predicting are light intensity, air temperature, air humidity, and water temperature. Additional features are light accumulation and day of growth. Preprocessing steps are implemented to improve the performance of the SVR model which are feature scaling using standard scaling and feature selection using Pearson correlation.

The purpose of this study is to improve the performance of PIR sensor network-based AR using PCA as a pre-processing method and compare the performance with AR in previous studies. In addition, KNN is used as the classification method for AR. To do that, a PIR sensor network needs to be built. 4 PIR sensor nodes are used throughout a test environment house. There are 37150 data that has been collected from all PIR sensors stored in a span of 21 days to build the KNN model. The accuracy results obtained from the KNN model for AR classification is 0.94.

WSN often has limitations in storage space and energy capacity. An appropriate network protocol simulation mechanism is needed to streamline the energy used in each sensor node to maximize performance between sensor nodes. A Cluster Head (CH) in the WSN system functions as the main sensor in this network. CHs have the duty to collect data from sensors around the cup and then forward it to the Base Station. One of the Cluster Head selection methods used is the Dynamic Cluster Head Selection Method (DCHSM) which is a Cluster Head selection method chosen based on probability. The DCHSM grouping method is assisted by a Voronoi diagram aimed at grouping the strategic points of the Cluster Head. The advantage of using the DCHSM method is the notion of CH rotations that are formed sequentially to maintain data traffic between nodes, and save energy used. To measure the performance of DCHSM in conserving energy, this research aims to provide a comparison. The comparison is made between three distinguished WSN CH selection methods, namely DCHSM, DEEC, and LEECH. DEEC and LEECH are considered legacy methods. The comparison is carried out through a simulation using Matlab. The results show that DCHSM is the most energy conserving CH selection method. When compared with LEACH & DEEC, the DCHSM test results of the distribution graph and active nodes are more significant, that is 7.12 ."

However, conventional surveys and monitoring still involve humans on the site. If a survey is conducted during strong wind conditions or in dangerous area, it could jeopardize the surveyor's safety. Therefore, a vehicle must have several criteria, e.g., it must be large enough and comfortable to carry surveyors, free from engine vibrations, stabilized and easy to maneuver, and the surveyor's safety can be guaranteed. This paper discusses preliminary research to develop an Autonomous Raft Vehicle (ARV), a type of autonomous unmanned surface vehicle. The ARV is equipped with autonomous control based on multi way-points with an A* algorithm. Thus, a user only requires giving a command once during path planning. A* algorithm over way-point could improve ARV navigation when there are obstacles along the desired trajectory. Hence the trajectory will be maintained throughout the mission.

This paper proposes a face mask detection model using the Haar Cascade method to detect faces that have been modified and trained to detect face mask features on human faces. The dataset to be used in the form of faces with face masks has been collected through several datasets on the Internet. To evaluate the model created, tests were carried out on several scenarios of different lighting conditions to see the effect on several metrics, namely accuracy and average delay.

This study aims to evaluate the parameters in building an SVM model for hand gesture detection in smart lighting control. In this study, 8 gestures were defined to turn on and off 4 different lights, then the data were collected through a smartwatch that has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor. Feature selection using Pearson Correlation is then carried out on 36 features extracted from each gesture data. Two sets of gestures were compared to evaluate the effect of gesture selection on model performance. The results from the first set of gestures show that the accuracy of 10 features compared to the accuracy of 36 features is 94 compared to 71 respectively. Furthermore, the second set of gestures has an accuracy that is lower than the first set of gestures, which is 64 . Results show that the lower the number of features the better the accuracy. Then, the set of gestures that are not too distinctive show lower accuracy than the highly distinctive gesture sets. The conclusion is, in implementing gesture detection with SVM, low data dimensions need to be maintained through feature selection methods and a distinctive set of gesture selection is required for a model with good performance."

Physical unclonable function (PUF) is the strongest and lightest method to securing memory devices and can be used on unmanned IoT devices. The advantage of PUF over current classical cryptography types is its compatibility on IoT devices with limited computing resources. However, before PUF can be claimed to provide security property, it must meet the evaluation indicators: randomness, uniqueness, and steadiness. PUF can be the best solution for securing data on IoT devices because the encryption process does not put a secret key on the device. Instead, the key is generated randomly. This research is evaluating two different PUF chips with the same PUF design. We designed the arbiter PUF on the FPGA and evaluated the results of the responses given.

However, not all machine learning algorithms have optimal performance in detecting a malware PE File because some have several weaknesses that result in low performance in detecting a malware PE File.

An authenticated key exchange method to provide cryptography sessions is the best way to provide information security and secure authentication. However, smart healthcare devices do not have sufficient computation to perform heavy cryptography processes due to the limitations of the embedded devices used. We propose an authenticated key exchange protocol based on a physical unclonable function (PUF). The proposed protocol aimed to countermeasure from replay and eavesdropping attacks. We designed our protocol with one handshake process and three authentication processes. We evaluated our proposed protocol using Tamarin Prover. From the results of the evaluation, our proposed protocol can exchange properties correctly between communication actors and is valid in proving each lemma in eavesdropping and replay attacks."

Therefore a solution is needed to overcome this problem. This study proposes a system that can detect other road users in the blind spot area. This system uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module to detect the presence of objects (smartphones) belonging to other road users. Prediction of the distance to the road user is obtained by calculating the RSSI value between the user's smartphone and the detecting BLE module. Meanwhile, the object's position is obtained by using a multilateration algorithm. In this study, the Kalman Filter is also used to suppress the noise obtained during the target detection process. Detection results in the form of user distance and location prediction are displayed on the driver's smartphone screen. Testing the detection of vehicles in a blind spot area in stationary conditions produces an accuracy value of 88.3 ."

Checking whether the proposed system has a significant effect on the bok choy hydroponic growth is also an important aspect and becomes the contribution of this paper. On the proposed hydroponic automation systems, light-feeding is done automatically, this can be carried out with the help of a real-time clock (RTC) module and relays. Furthermore, the monitoring function is carried out through temperature and humidity measurement sensors. The data obtained from the sensor will be stored in the database for research on plant quality. The results of a comparison test show that the LED grow lights are superior in terms of fresh weight, the number of leaves, and plant height respectively with an average value of 23.6 grams, 11.2 leaves, and 18.1 cm on the 30th day. Compared to sunlight, respectively with an average value of 20.2 grams, 9.3 leaves, and 17.1 cm on the 30th day. PDF calculation and t-test are used to calculate the growth significance. The results are that the H0 for fresh weight and leaf growth rate are rejected and the H0 for plant growth rate is not rejected.

One of the protocols that are often used in IoT communication is the MQTT protocol. The MQTT protocol uses less bandwidth, is light in computing, and is fast in transmission. Thus, the MQTT protocol can be applied to constraint devices. However, the MQTT protocol lacks a security mechanism by default. The use of TLS in the MQTT protocol does not suitable for constraint devices. One of the vulnerabilities encountered in the MQTT protocol is authentication. The lack of authentication causes unauthorized nodes to use MQTT network resources which can lead to over-connection. This study used the JSON Web Token (JWT) to build a token-based authentication mechanism on MQTT as a second authentication factor other than username and password. This was done to prevent the access of unauthenticated nodes to enter the MQTT network. From the validation results, the proposed authentication mechanism is validated for brute force and sniffing attacks. The proposed authentication mechanism validated that there are not exist unauthenticated nodes that can log in into the MQTT network. In addition, the proposed authentication mechanism is validated that the message sent has been encrypted using the XXTEA encryption algorithm to maintain the confidentiality of the communication. The proposed authentication mechanism can be run on constraint devices using 405912 bytes (38 of total program storage) on publisher nodes and 406856 (38 of total program storage) on subscriber nodes."

The other problem also arises when the calculation of in-store visitors and people passing are executed manually, so it requires much effort. This study proposes a prototype design of the system which can automatically calculate visitors by utilizing Single Shot Detector (SSD) method. This method is performed by operating OpenCV library. It is used to detect a human object marked as in-store visitor or people passing. The embedded computer is conducted to process images captured by Pi Camera. Based on the study, the result accuracy is 65.08 for the system counts in-store visitors, and 66.12 for the system marks objects as people pass around in front of the store. Although the accuracy values obtained is not high, but all patterns show that the highest average values of in-store visitors and people passing occur on the days nearing weekend and also on the weekend, such as Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The peak time of in-store visitors (e.g. power hour) on Friday is between 12 PM and 1 PM.

However, these questions need to be reviewed so the questions can be matched with the achievement of competence. One educational identification standard that is often to improve the quality of the questions is Bloom's Taxonomy. Bloom's Taxonomy was created in 1956 and revised in 2001. This study compares the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na??ve Bayes (NB) algorithms to classify quiz questions based on the cognitive level of Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. In this study, the dataset received two treatments in handling the imbalanced class. One dataset is using SMOTE method, and one another is not using any oversampling methods. The result shows that classification with oversampling datasets had better results than those without oversampling. The SVM algorithm with SMOTE has the highest accuracy of 98 , rather than the NB algorithm with SMOTE has an accuracy of 91 ."

Mental health is a good emotional and psychological state, where a person has cognitive and emotional abilities that function well in everyday life. To achieve a healthy mentality is not easy, we ourselves often release excessive emotions in an event. In a era that demands the use of technology as it is today, the longer it can make users become addicted to gadgets. Because of that, most people's minds become restless and unfocused, before something unwanted happens, someone tends to look for the easiest solution to find, one of which is to meet someone who can help our problems, be it a close friend or a professional person. in his field as a counselor. From the problems above, it is necessary to take preventive measures before someone is declared mentally unhealthy. Given today's increasingly sophisticated technology and everyone cannot be separated from the internet, the authors create solutions related to mental health, namely websites that can prevent stress and provide useful features for mental health assisted by counselors. This mental health website is called Pahamee. The author designed several client user modules such as user data management, online counseling, and discussion forums. To perfect the making of this website, the author uses the Extreme programming method with stages, namely planning, design, coding, and testing.

Like nondeterministic approach, the affix rule checker in the proposed stemmer generated several word candidates from the input word. Then, the candidates are selected using two steps. First, they filtered by root word dictionary, list of compound words, and list of rare words. Second, if there were still more than a word candidate, the best word was the one with the highest average similarity score from the word to its context and the ambiguous word itself. To calculate the similarity score of words, a word model derived from word2vec training was used. Experiments showed that the proposed stemmer accuracy was 99.65 on average.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, approximately 9.6 million deaths were caused by cancer. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths are caused by cancer. One way to detect cancer is to use microarray data classification. Microarray technology is used to detect the expression of thousands of genes at the same time to analyze and diagnose cancer. However, microarray data have high dimensions because of its large features and low data distribution, which means that it has a small data samples, which causes low performance. To overcome this problem, dimension reduction is needed. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the dimensions of microarray data with Random Projection (RP) to reduce the high dimensions and use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) as classification methods. The classification method will be compared and analyzed to determine which classification method produces the best performance by using Random Projection (RP) as a dimensional reduction method. Based on the system that has been built, the best accuracy for Colon Tumor is 69.23 with Random Projection (RP)-SVM, Lung Cancer is 100 for both methods classification, Ovarian Cancer is 100 for both methods classification, the prostate tumor is 95.12 for both methods classification and Central Nervous System is 66.66 for both methods classification."

In this paper, we propose an approach on dataset preprocessing, which is applied to diabetes prediction. The preprocessing approach consists of the following process: missing value process, imbalanced data process, feature importance process, and data augmentation process. The data preprocessing process uses the median for missing value, random oversampling for imbalanced data, the Gini score in the random forest for feature importance, and posterior distribution for data augmentation. We used random forest and logistic regression as classification algorithms. The experimental results show that the classification increased by 20 precision and 24 recall by applying our proposed method and random forest method compared to without proposed method and random forest method."

Some of the specialties that have studied are the regularities in the number of letters, words, vocabularies, etc. In the past, the early Islamic scholars identify these regularities manually, i.e. by counting the occurrence of each vocabulary by hand. This research tackles this problem by utilizing centrality in quranic verse topic classification. The goal of this research is to analyze the effect of The Quran word centrality measure on the topic classification of The Quran verses. To achieve this objective, the method of this research is constructing the Quran word graph, then the score of centralities included as one of the features in the verse topic classification. The effect of centrality is observed along with support vector machine (SVM) and na??ve Bayes classifiers by performing two scenarios (with stopword and without stopword removal). The result shows that according to the centrality measure the word ???( ???????????Allah) is the most central in The Quran. The performance evaluation of the classification models shows that the use of centrality improves the hamming loss score from 0.43 to 0.21 on na??ve Bayes classifier with stopword removal.

One of the accreditation assessment factors is the percentage of graduation on time. A low percentage of on-time graduations can affect the assessment of accreditation of study programs. Predicting student graduation can be a solution to this problem. The prediction results can show that students are at risk of not graduating on time. Temporal prediction allows students and study programs to do the necessary treatment early. Prediction of graduation can use the learning analytics method, using a combination of the na??ve bayes and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The Na??ve Bayes algorithm looks for the courses that most influence graduation. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm as a classification method with the attribute limit used is 40 of the total attributes so that the algorithm becomes more effective and efficient. The dataset used is four batches of Telkom University Informatics Engineering student data involving data index of course scores 1, level 2, level 3, and level 4 data. The results obtained from this study are 5 attributes that most influence student graduation.

One of the supporting element of the manifestation of a subculture is the existence of products from certain brands that have authenticity. The authenticity of a brand can be formed through the interaction of a brand with its community. A brand is not constructed by itself, but it must be built with various actions towards a community with its own ecosystem so as to give rise to consumer attitudes and habits towards a brand's product. Previous studies have shown that general consumers with subcultural actors show different attitudes towards a product from a certain brand. Another study shows that brands imitate the behavior patterns of a subculture and make it their target market to sell products. This study aims to take another approach, namely a sociological approach, by conducting a case study of a brand that is associative with a subcultural movement, one of which is Maternal Disaster. The method used in this study was an unstructured interview with the owner of the Maternal Disaster brand, visual samples analysis and an analysis based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu.

However, in 2019, many broiler poultry farmers are forced to close down their businesses because the price of broilers in living conditions continues to be below the Production Cost. Further, broiler poultry farmers also experience obstacles including unpredictable price fluctuations and intense competition. Innovation ambidexterity is the innovation capability in managing exploration and exploitation simultaneously to improve firm performance. Several influential factors in increasing innovation ambidexterity include technological capability, owner-manager characteristic, and environmental dynamism. This study aims to develop a model that describes innovation ambidexterity in broiler poultry farmers to improve firm performance. This study also analyzes the factors that can influence innovation ambidexterity and its effect on firm performance. This research mainly uses quantitative methods for its analysis. The sampling technique uses non-probability sampling with convenience sampling technique. Data collection was conducted by distributing 223 questionnaires to broiler poultry farmers in West Java. The analysis technique uses Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) which includes measurement model analysis and structural model analysis. The results of this study indicate that innovation ambidexterity has a direct influence on firm performance, while the influence of environmental dynamism on firm performance is partly mediated by innovation ambidexterity. In addition, technological capability and owner-manager characteristics have a positive influence on innovation ambidexterity and have an indirect influence on firm performance. In the near future, implications of this study will be discussed in a separate manuscript."

However, the concept of Smart Farming is about measurable data based on available computational techniques that are trained and then produce knowledge. What do plants need to achieve beneficial yields? What should the farmer do for this? All can be solved by implementing Smart Farming. Like the Agri Drone Sprayer, it can be used for the process of applying pesticides and liquid fertilizers on each side. In addition, Drone Surveillance is also useful in implementing smart farming such as mapping land so that farmers will know the condition of their agricultural land. However, Soil and Weather Sensor will also help farmers to monitor agricultural land as well. Devices with sensors can only retrieve data in the form of air and soil humidity, temperature, soil pH, moisture content, and forecast harvest time. The concept of developing information technology based on data will be accepted by farmers if there is an abnormal situation in their land conditions. In addition, the smart farming model can help farmers get recommendations in preventing predictable damage to their land and crops.

This paper presents the automatic extraction feature with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique to get a unique characteristic of palmprint image and identify a person. CNN will get easier to classify the image database if it has many data. CNN belongs to Supervised Learning, which requires training data to create a knowledge base. In the dataset with little training data, the system must increase the training data using augmentation methods like zoom, shear, and rotate. Still, in the palmprint, that augmentation method can change the original character of the palmprint. Our proposed method is adding training data with an edge detection image from the original image. Edge detection used in our method is Canny and Sobel. The addition of Canny and Sobel edge detection for training data is the best combination scenario for palmprint recognition. The experiment results showed that palmprint recognition using Convolution Neural Network with Canny and Sobel edge detection for training data resulted in an accuracy rate of 96.5 for 200 classes, and the Equal Error Rate (ERR) value is 3.5 .

This condition also causes a decrease in the production process's quality because the data held is still inaccurate due to decision-making in the company. Therefore, a monitoring system is needed to analyze and monitor the returned product data to support sustainable supply chain management through key performance indicators (KPI) environmentally friendly to solve these problems. This study aims to design an integrated dashboard monitoring system of an ERP system that supports sustainable supply chain management in reverse logistics module through key performance indicators."

Of the various activities in the construction sector, each activity can have an impact on the environment. Sustainability supply chain (SSCM) is a concept in the supply chain process that pays attention to three aspects, namely social, economic, and environmental in carrying out supply chain activities. This SSCM concept integrates these three aspects to obtain a sustainable supply chain process. Evaluation of material management activities, especially social and environmental aspects in the supply chain, can be measured through a supply chain performance sustainability approach. This study uses the Sustainable Balanced Scorecard model to map the supply chain strategy and the Supply Chain Operational Reference model to map business processes and determine metrics and ISO 14001 as a clause for the work environment. Based on the integration of the two models, a performance measurement metric is obtained which is used as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in measuring a sustainable supply chain. Based on the perspective of the BSC model, the research in this final project uses three BSC perspectives, namely the financial perspective, the internal business process perspective, and the learning and growth perspective. These three perspectives were chosen based on the company's material management business processes. All company strategies that have been mapped into the previous BSC perspective are remapped with an overview of the relationship between strategies across perspectives. The priority vector shows the weight of each criterion from the matrix. In the financial perspective indicators, weighting is not carried out because the indicators in the financial perspective are not compared to the PCJM questionnaire. The criteria assessment is said to be consistent if the value of the Consistency Ratio is the Consistency Index divided by the Random Index 0.1. Based on the results of the consistency test, it is known that the value of the importance scale is fairly consistent because the entire consistency ratio value is less than 0.1. This final project obtains 20 KPIs, which are divided into financial, internal business process and learning & growth perspectives. Based on data collection and processing, the metrics/indicators used are one (1) indicator from the financial perspective, sixteen (16) indicators from the Internal Business Process perspective and three (3) indicators from the Learning & Growth perspective."

As a result of this situation, investors prefer to move their money into a safer portfolio. Therefore, in this study, we approach an efficient portfolio model using smart beta and combining others to obtain a fast method to predict investment stock returns. Smart beta is a method to selects stocks that will enter a portfolio quickly and concisely by considering the level of return and risk that has been set according to the ability of investors. A smart beta portfolio is efficient because it tracks with an underlying index and is optimized using the same techniques that active portfolio managers utilize. Using the logistic regression method and the data of 100 low volatility stocks listed on the Indonesia stock exchange from 2009???2019, an efficient portfolio model was made. It can be concluded that an efficient portfolio is formed by a group of stocks that are aggressive and actively traded to produce optimal returns at a certain level of risk in the long-term period. And also, the portfolio selection model generated using the smart beta, beta, alpha, and stock variants is a simple and fast model in predicting the rate of return with an adjusted risk level so that investors can anticipate risks and minimize errors in stock selection."

Corruption occurs when public money or state money is not used in accordance with the will of the people and is not allocated properly. This paper seeks to reveal the position and role of women in eradicating corruption in Indonesia. The existence of women in politics can be seen clearly with the increase in the number of women's participation in politics. Women began to show their potential, qualities and convince the public that they could bring about positive changes in government. The role of women in government and politics is followed by the increasing number of women who are suspects and convicted of corruption cases in Indonesia. The research uses a qualitative method with a phenomenological approach and data obtained from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and in-depth studies of the results of a survey of women's perceptions of corruption in Indonesia. The results of the study show that in several corruption cases, women often become objects or victims and are also perpetrators of corruption. Women in Indonesia also consider corruption as a common thing that has even become a culture in people's lives. The position of women in corruption can be divided into four positions, namely as an object, abject, anti-subject, and subject. The role of women is very important in the anti-corruption movement, so that anti-corruption attitudes and actions take root in all levels of society."

Our first contribution is to develop the Big Five personality trait-based model to detect human personalities from their textual data in the Indonesian language. The model uses an ontology approach instead of a more famous ma-chine learning model. The former better captures the meaning and intention of phrases and words in the do-main of human personality. The legacy and more thorough ways to assess nature are by doing interviews or by giving questionnaires. Still, there are many real-life applications where we need to possess an alternative method, which is cheaper and faster than the legacy methodology to select individuals based on their person-ality. The second contribution is to support the model implementation by building a personality measurement platform. We use two distinct features for the model: an n-gram sorting algorithm to parse the textual data and a crowdsourcing mechanism that facilitates public involvement contributing to the ontology corpus addition and filtering."

Sedangkan pada masa covid19 seorang apresiator dalam proses apresiasinya terhadap karya seni rupa (pengalaman estetiknya) sangat terbatas, karena hanya mengandalkan visual virtual layaknya melihat tontonan televisi. Banyak teori estetika yang syarat utamanya adalah pengamatan langsung terhadap karya seni untuk menghasilkan pengalaman estetik yang utuh bagi para apresiator seni sebelum datangnya pandemi yang melanda dunia. Kenyataan covid19 yang sedang melanda dunia ini membuat kesulitan para apresiator karya seni rupa untuk memenuhi syarat estetika yang menuntut pengamatan langsung. Profesor Jakop Sumardja mengatakan bahwa pengalaman artistik tak mungkin terjadi tanpa pengalaman estetik. Artinya seseorang membuat karya seni harus terlebih dahulu memiliki pengalaman estetik, mengapresiasi karya seni yang melibatkan seluruh yang ada pada seseorang tersebut.Seseorang dengan banyak referensi al-Quran dan Hadits dan diperkuat dengan pengalaman estetik yang berkaitan dengan benda estetik berupa karya-karya seni rupa Islam maka besar kemungkinan ekspresi seni atau pengalaman artistiknya sangat kuat dengan konsep-konsep Islam. Sebenarnya nilai-nilai estetik bukan pada benda/artefak seni tetapi dari kualitas pengalaman apresiator itu sendiri. Profesor Musa Asy???arie dalam kajian tentang estetika Islamnya menyebutkan bahwa nilai estetis merangkum tiga prinsip ideal yaitu; kebenaran, kebaikan, dan keindahan.

One of the main ingredients experiencing this is eggs, which often experience a significant increase, so it is necessary to make observations in the form of predictions to keep control of fluctuations, especially before and after the big day occurs. In this study, predictions were made on the price of basic commodities on the big day. With the prediction of the cost of goods on the big day, it is hoped that related parties can be assisted in monitoring and stabilizing the movement of basic commodity prices on the market. In this study, a prediction system for the price of basic commodities was produced using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) method. This MLP method can predict time-series data that experiences a lot of fluctuation. In this prediction, MLP can make predictions on ten prices of basic commodities on major holidays every day. The results of this study were divided into three groups, namely Worst, Average, and Best. The division of these three groups separates which staple ingredients have the closest predictions to their actual values. The Worst group is the group whose prediction results are still quite far from the actual, the Average group which is close to the actual value, and the Best group which has the best results because it is very close to the actual value.

To overcome the decline in the animal population, a classification model was built to classify images that focuses on the pattern of body covering possessed by animals. However, in designing an accurate classification model with an optimal level of accuracy, it is necessary to consider many aspects such as the dataset used, the number of parameters, and computation time. In this study, we propose an animal image classification model that focuses on animal body covering by combining the Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Initially, the input image is processed to take the body covering pattern of the animal and converted it into a grayscale image. Then, the image is segmented by employing the median filter and the Otsu method. Therefore, the noise contained in the image can be removed and the image can be segmented. The results of the segmentation image are then extracted by using the PHOG and then proceed with the classification process by implementing the SVM. The experimental results showed that the classification model has an accuracy of 91.07 ."

In this work, an optimization model to compute optimal crop allocations for each sub-district is proposed and solved by a genetic algorithm (GA) to find the best solutions. The land utility is formulated as the margin between the possible cost and revenue base on the data collected from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics data. The result analysis can support decision-making for allocation crop production planning in practice to increase agricultural revenue in the Cianjur regency. A genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal solution that maximizes the margin function with some realistic conditions obtained from the government's allowed land restriction. The computation results show that the highest optimal value is 30.65 on the log scale. The fitness constant to this asymptotic rise is after 17 generations, so that it converges quickly for some experimental GA parameter setting. In the optimal allocation results, the sweet potato gains the smallest portion, followed by cassava that is only around 2 of the total plantation area. Meanwhile, the largest portion of land allocation is suggested to be corn, based on the optimal solution returning the maximum profit margin. For all crops, the Cidaun sub-district appears to be the most expansive land area in Cianjur."

First, the high-quality big males do a novel movement called high-exploitation low-exploration to produce better solutions. Next, the middle-quality female generates a better solution by either mating the highest-quality big male (exploitation) or doing parthenogenesis (exploration). Finally, the low-quality small males diversify candidate solutions using a novel movement called mlipir (a Javanese term defined as a walk on the side of the road to reach a particular destination safely), which is implemented by following the big males in a part of their dimensions. A self-adaptation of the population is also proposed to control the exploitation-exploration balance. An examination using the well-documented twenty-three benchmark functions shows that KMA outperforms the recent metaheuristic algorithms. Besides, it provides high scalability to optimize thousand-dimensional functions."

A way to reduce the impact of this problem is to detect the presence of cancer early on. For detecting the presence of cancer in the bones, we have to perform a whole-body bone scan and segment it afterward. In many studies about whole-body bone scan images segmentation, the data usually comes from one source. Therefore, data scarcity problems may occur. The idea of using different sources may have an impact since there are size differences in bone geometry between different ethnicities. In this study, a system that can segment whole-body bone scan images automatically is proposed. The system is designed by using the Btrfly-Net method. Furthermore, the impact of using cross-domain dataset and augmentation methods is observed. The result shows that the system can segment bone scan with 0.856 and 0.780 dice coefficient score using the Btrfly-Net and U-Net methods, respectively. Moreover, augmentation method could increase the Btrfly-Net system metric over 1 while decreasing U-Net system metric over 2-6 . The decreasing metric occurrence in the U-Net system is not caused by the augmentation method directly. Furthermore, there are metric differences in using cross-domain dataset over 3-6 . However, further analysis shows that the cross-domain themselves do not cause the differences."

In previous studies, the Genetic Algorithm as a feature selection method and the Momentum Backpropagation algorithm as a classification method provide a fairly high classification performance, but the Momentum Backpropagation algorithm still has a low convergence rate because the learning rate used is still static. The low convergence rate makes the training process need more time to converge. Therefore, in this research an optimization of the Momentum Backpropagation algorithm is done by adding an adaptive learning rate scheme. The proposed scheme is proven to reduce the number of epochs needed in the training process from 390 epochs to 76 epochs compared to the Momentum Backpropagation algorithm.

In the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, accurately predicting the sale and purchase price of apartments is essential to minimize the impact of losses, thus making apartment prices attractive to predict. The machine learning approach used to predict the apartment price index are the Random Forest method, the Multiple Regression method, and the Backpropagation method. This study aims to determine which method is more effective in predicting small amounts of data accuracy. The data used is apartment price index data from 2012 to 2019 in the JABODEBEK area. The research will produce prediction accuracy that will determine the effectiveness of the application of the method. The Random Forest method with parameters n_estimators 100 and max_features ???log2??? produces an R2 accuracy of 0.977. The Multiple Regression method with a correlation between the selling price and rental price variables is 0.746, and the rental inflation variable is 0.042 produces an R2 accuracy of 0.559. The Backpropagation method with a 1000-4000-1 hidden scheme and 20000 iterations produces an R2 accuracy of 0.996. Therefore, the Backpropagation method is more suitable in this study compared to the other two methods. The Backpropagation method is suitable because it gets almost perfect accuracy, so this method will minimize losses in investing in buying and selling apartments in the Covid-19 pandemic era."

Standard security on MQTT uses SSL/TLS, but SSL/TLS is computationally wasteful for low-powered devices. The use of fuzzy logic algorithms with the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) scheme is suitable for detecting DoS because of its simple nature. This paper uses a fuzzy logic algorithm embedded in a node to detect DoS in the MQTT protocol with feature selection nodes. This paper's contribution is that the nodes feature selection used will monitor SUBSCRIBE and SUBACK traffic and provide this information to fuzzy input nodes to detect DoS attacks. Fuzzy performance evaluation is measured against changes in the number of nodes and attack intervals. The results obtained are that the more the number of nodes and the higher the traffic intensity, the fuzzy performance will decrease, and vice versa. However, the number of nodes and traffic intensity will affect fuzzy performance."

In order to back up this ultra-high-speed internet access and the other services in the mobile communication network, a large mobile backhaul capacity is mandatory. 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON) is one of the mobile backhaul technologies that has the potential to resolve this issue because of its capability to deliver 10 Gbps upstream and downstream simultaneously. This study evaluates the XGS-PON's performance to implement mobile backhaul in a cellular network in Indonesia. The evaluation is conducted on Optical Network Termination (ONT) XGS-PON that is dedicated to mobile backhaul. The ONT's performance under the XGS-PON standard is evaluated through several capabilities testing of the ONT PON interface, data link function, and synchronization function. The ONT PON interface capability assessment uses nominal rate, wavelength, launch power, sensitivity, and overload parameters. The data link function is examined by the jumbo frame, VLAN ID capacity, VLAN transparent, and VLAN Tagging. The synchronization capability ensures IEEE 1588v2 and Synchronous Ethernet (Sync-E) are operating correctly in XGS-PON ONT. The testing results confirmed that XGS-PON ONT supported mobile backhaul with nominal rate 9.65296 Gbps, an operating wavelength of 1269.509 nm, launch power 5.63 dBm, sensitivity -26.64 dBm, and overload -5.92 dBm.

As a result, this research will plan a 5G New Radio (NR) network implementation employing a 28 GHz mmWave frequency. The dense urban scenario research design was carried out by selecting Central Jakarta as the research object. Central Jakarta was chosen as a pilot project because it is feasible in market potential and infrastructure support to prepare 5G implementation in Indonesia. The capacity approach considers the data rate and users, while the coverage approach considers Maximum Allowable Path Loss (MAPL) parameters and path loss propagation.

Power limitation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) become one of problems in Internet of Things (IoT) network.

However, Cluster Head (CH) in LEACH protocol forwarding the packet directly to the sink node, so CH which located far from sink node will running out of energy sooner than the closer one. This research develops methods to save power usage from sensor node and to eliminate long link in LEACH protocol so WSN lifetime could be extended. PEGASIS protocol chaining method are adapted to eliminate long link. This method allows CHs to establish chain connection instead of forwarding the packet to sink node directly. The packet will relay forwarded from a CH to other CH up to Leader Node (LN). In this research, LN that elected is CH with the closest distance to sink node.

INTRODUCTION The population of Indonesia has increased in the last ten years. Starting from 2010 to 2020, the population in Indonesia has increased by 32.56 million people, or an average increase of 3.26 million people each year [1]. As the population increases, the demand for motorbikes also increases by 6.2 per year [2]. The use of the increasing number of motorbikes has made parking areas a necessity [3]. However, the limited location of the parking area can cause twowheelers to spend time and fuel in finding the location of the designated parking area [4], [5], [6]. This problem is followed by a lack of information regarding the maximum number of parking slot capacities and the number of available parking slot capacities. Twowheeled vehicle users also need to know the route they will trip to the desired parking area. In addition, there needs to be additional motivation for two-wheeled riders to balance the available parking area [7], [8]. Previous research by Eka Santi Wahyuningtyas, Rendy Munadi, and Sussi has made a smart parking application that can provide information about the parking capacity of two-wheeled vehicles. This application is integrated with the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensor, placed at the entrance and exit gates of the two-wheeled vehicle parking area at Telkom University [9]. The weakness of this research is that the number of parking areas that are informed is limited to only one parking area, and the application used cannot show the route taken to the parking lot desired by two-wheeled riders. The use of a parking area limited to one location makes the C"

Whereas early diagnosis shows that more than 90 can be cured, while delay in diagnosis shows less than 50 can be cured. For this reason, this research was conducted to design and implement a system that can classify skin cancer in order to facilitate the skin detection process to be faster. This study applied the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using the Alexnet architecture to classify skin cancers into four categories, namely dermatofibromas, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma. Experiments were carried out using a dataset obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset of 4000 images of skin cancer conditions of dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma, consisting of 1000 images in each class. The amount of training data used is 2700 skin cancer images. While the number of validation data used is 900 images. Then the remaining 400 images were used as test data. The experimental results using training data and validation data show that the best optimizer is Adam and the use of a learning rate of 0.001 produces an accuracy value of 99 and a loss value of 0.0596 on the applied Alexnet architecture.

However, prolonged acquisition time is yet a bottleneck that can lead to patient discomfort in addition to the cost constrain and exposure to X-rays used by CT. In medical imaging technologies and implementations, effective sampling and transmission techniques are some of the main areas of study to overcome such problems. To fulfill this requirement, the compressive sensing (CS) technique was introduced demonstrating that such compression is possible and can be accomplished throughout the process of data restoration; and that the uncompressed frames can be recovered employing a scalable approach of computational optimization. Sparsity averaging reweighted analysis (SARA) was proposed in compressed imaging, exploiting multi-basis sparsity with averaging approach and basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) with high signal to noise (SNR) results. In SARA, the processing time is not considered due to the high processing time because of iteration in the reweighted process and it is not feasible for the medical image that needs fast processing with high SNR result. To fulfill this gap, this paper proposes total variation based average sparsity model with reweighted analysis for CT imaging. The SNR, structural similarity index (SSIM), and processing time are used as performance metrics for the comparison of the proposed and existing techniques. From detailed experimental results, the proposed technique outperforms the existing CS techniques and is considered as a feasible solution for compressed sensing (CS) based CT images compression with faster delay process and better visual quality for medical images."

Berbagai upaya untuk mengurangi angka kematian wanita Indonesia akibat kanker serviks telah banyak dilakukan, salah satunya dengan melakukan screening kanker menggunakan tes inspeksi visual asam asetat (tes IVA). Tes ini merupakan upaya screening untuk mengetahui pra-cancer atau invasive cancer pada kanker serviks dengan memunculkan Acetowhite Epithelium Zone (AEZ) yang dapat dikategorikan sebagai lesi IVA positif maupun lesi jinak. Umumnya, AEZ dapat dilihat dengan kasat mata yang memerlukan keahlian khusus sehingga hasil pengamatannya akan bersifat subjektif dan bergantung pada pengalaman operator. Selain itu, utilitas pemeriksaan kanker serviks ini pun dinilai terbatas dikarenakan sedikitnya jumlah operator ahli yang terlatih. Pada penelitian ini, lesi pra-kanker serviks dikuantifikasi dengan pengolahan citra digital. Citra yang digunakan adalah citra hasil inspeksi visual asam asetat atau citra area mulut rahim yang telah diolesi oleh asam asetat dan dinyatakan terdapat sambungan skuamosa kolumnar (SSK) positif. Kuantifikasi citra lesi pra-kanker serviks dilakukan dengan menggunakan metode standarisasi karakter warna citra pada RGB dan HSV. Pengujian system deteksi lesi pra-kanker serviks diukur dengan menggunakan parameter akurasi, sensitivitas dan spesifisitas terhadap pengaruh tingkat kecerahan dan mean filter. Melalui penelitian ini didapatkan klasifikasi citra tes IVA beserta area lesi IVA positif yang optimal dengan tingkat akurasi 81 , nilai sensitivitas 78 dan nilai spesifisitas 84 .

This study proposes a watermarking scheme on the image using the Arnold cat map and hybrid transform (Fast Discrete Curvelet Transforms (FDCuT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)). The Arnold Cat Map technique is applied to pre-processing to increase security and reduce the likelihood of targeted attacks. Experiments were carried out on six modalities: MRI image, X-Ray, CT scan, ultrasound, eye image, and fundus scan. The experimental results show that the watermarked image produces excellent imperceptibility with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 50 dB, and the structural similarity index (SSIM) is close to 1. The value of bit error rate (BER) 0 and normalized correlation (NC) 1 are obtained in conditions without attack. This technique is resistant to various attacks, namely JPEG compression, adding noise, and filtering. Therefore, the proposed watermarking scheme has good imperceptibility and robustness to be applied in e-health applications."

The robust watermarking technique is a solution to secure and maintain multimedia data information, especially images. The embedded watermark will be challenging to remove and can be recovered even though various attacks change it. The designed system has two processes, i.e., insertion process, and extraction process. The fast discrete curvelet transform and redundant discrete wavelet transform methods are applied to the host image. The watermark is inserted into the image by applying a discrete cosine transform to the watermark. Then, the singular watermark value is entered into the unique value of the host image using the singular value decomposition method. While in the extraction process, the watermark will be extracted to restore the appearance without damaging the host image. In this study, host image is grayscale with a size of 512??512 pixels and a watermark in the form of binary data with a size of 128??128 pixels. the study results obtained a maximum peak signal to noise ratio value of 71.7630 dB, a maximum structural similarity index metric 1, a maximum normalized correlation 1, and a bit error rate 0, which means this scheme has good imperceptibility. the proposed watermarking scheme can withstand the attacks of JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, salt & pepper, speckle noise, gaussian filtering, and rotation."

Seizures appear unexpectedly, posing a risk of injury and even death, particularly when they operate heavy machinery or drive a vehicle. As a result, developing a system that can predict the emergence of epileptic seizures is essential. Re-search on the identification of epileptic seizures using CNN can also be done by first translating EEG signals into 2D / 3D images. To alleviate this challenge, we introduce a methodology that uses a 1D-CNN architecture to diagnose epileptic seizures based on raw EEG data. The 1D-CNN model consists of five convolutional layers followed by flatten and dense layers. The proposed method is tested using three scenarios, the first scenario is normal vs pre-ictal, the second is normal vs ictal, and the third is classifying EEG signal into three classes (normal vs pre-ictal vs ictal). The proposed 1D-CNN model delivers a great performance by providing precision, recall, and f1-score up to 0.99. The accuracy ranged between 94.9 - 96.30 for seizure detection scenario, 97.92 -99.58 for seizure prediction scenario and 89.79 - 97.01 for three classes problem classification. This result indicates that the proposed method can be utilized as input to relevant stake-holders for additional clinical studies, and it may be employed in the medical field in the future."

This analysis focuses on a term of user???s interaction technique considering two approach (direct and indirect interaction techniques) for the user while interact with three-dimensional objects. Numerous possible uses could benefit from virtual reality, taking into consideration a few fundamental visual and cognitive activities in the Virtual Environment, such as the interpretation of space where users of clear and indirect perception are not well established. The findings of this study show that, in the sense of a direct interaction technique, user recognition of an object appears to converge in the center of a simulated area. Unfortunately, this convergence was not demonstrated in the indirect cursor situation. The pointing estimation from the user were more accurate when using the indirect interaction approach. The finding of this study is give understanding the characteristics of interaction done by user in the stereoscopic environment. Importantly, developers of a virtual environment may use this result when developing effective user interface perception in specific interaction techniques."

The experiment included two modes of interaction: direct interaction and indirect interaction that utilize different techniques depending on how users interact with 3D objects. Both interaction techniques were conducted in three indexes of difficulties and three egocentric target distances (a distance from participant to target). Movement time and throughput were measured for each interaction technique. The results show that the direct pointing technique is more efficient for interaction with the targets close to the participant, while the indirect cursor technique may be a viable option for targets further away from participant. Throughputs were found to be significantly higher for the direct pointing technique compared to the indirect cursor technique. The results of the mean movement time were highly correlated with the targets??? index of difficulty for all interaction techniques, supporting evidence that Fitts??? law can be applied to the interactions in 3D virtual environment. Based on the results, developers of VE application may relate to these findings in designing proper users??? interactions."

Likewise, with the type of waste, it really depends on the type of material consumed, therefore waste management cannot be separated from the management of people's lifestyles. Waste problems have become a major topic, ranging from the smallest environment to the large scope, many things that cause this garbage accumulation, but certainly the individual factors are very influential in this. There are two types of garbage, namely organic waste (commonly referred to as wet waste) and inorganic waste (dry waste). One of them is inorganic waste. Telkom University, one of the educational institutions that donates paper waste is quite potential, whether it comes from former concepts, correspondence or ex-exams, especially semester exams which are not taken by students. The used paper contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, wax and miscellaneous, this content makes it possible to make art paper (fancy paper). Experiments carried out were scrap paper cut 3-5 cm in length with a cutting machine. Each batch uses 3 kg pieces of scrap paper heated in water with a ratio of 1: 7 ingredients and solutions with the addition of sodium hydroxide with variations of 10 and 20 , soaking time 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours. Furthermore, separation of black leachate with pulp is carried out thoroughly. The clean pulp is ground to form fibers (fibrillation) for 15-30 minutes, then filtered to determine the size of the pulp. The results of the pulp grinding process are brown, if the art paper will be colored it needs to be bleached before it is colored. The pulp is mixed with water in a ratio of 1: 20, then 1 tapioca is added. Finally, the pulp is printed in gauze molds of 150-200 mesh to the desired size, dried and the paper is ready to be used to craft art paper products. Some compositions between the weight of waste paper, soaking time, NaOH concentration, hot water and grinding time are intended to produce quality fancy paper. The optimum process conditions chosen depend on the fancy paper specifications desired to get thick fancy paper using a sample A process recipe with a composition of 10 NaOH, soaked for 3 hours and ground to pulp for 30 minutes, while to get thin paper with physical properties good enough to use a recipe for the K sample process with a composition of 20 NaOH, soaked for 3 hours and ground to pulp for 15 minutes."

SMEs are the pillars of the state's economy which has many limitations, including financial limitations. Several financial institutions are willing to provide financial assistance and one of the requirements is the transparency of the financial statements of SMEs. One solution for the transparency of financial reports is to use an e-accounting information system. Based on observations of several SMEs, there are facts that SMEs have not used a manual system in managing their finances or have not used the e-accounting system so that financial institutions have not been able to provide financial assistance. One of the reasons for the importance of an accounting system for financial institutions to make financial assistance a requirement for SMEs is the transparency of the flow of funds/financial use provided to SMEs. On the other hand, there are many factors that cause SMEs not to use e-accounting, including limited funds to purchase e-accounting software, limited knowledge to use e-accounting. The determination of this exploration is to build an open source-based e-accounting model and use the TAM to solve these problems. The outcome of this investigation is the TAM model for the adoption of open source e-accounting for SMEs. The resulting TAM model consists of several parts, namely: attending training accounting information system, collaborative learning between SMEs and outsource e-accounting resources."

However, the intention of farmers to do organic farming is still relatively limited. Many factors influence farmers' behavior intention, one of which is the perception of agriculture towards the organic farming system. This study aims to describe farmers' perceptions and intention in organic farming in North Maluku Province, using the UTAUT1 (Venkatest 2003) theoretical framework from venkatest. This study was designed as a quantitative study with a survey approach. The population of this study was vegetable farmers in North Maluku province. The sample of this study was 120 farmers spread across the city of Ternate and Tidore. This research data analysis used descriptive statistics. The results showed that the farmers' perceptions about organic agricultural cultivation were generally categorized as quite good / moderate. Only 1 indicator of a high perspective, namely farmers' perceptions of performance expectations or farmers believe that organic farming systems can improve their farming with a value of 3.38 ?? 0.6. The intention or intention of farmers to do organic farming is relatively diverse. As many as 36.7 percent have a strong desire, but 33.3 percent have a low intention."

Feminisme hampir dikatakan selalu melekat dalam kehidupan manusia khususnya pada gender perempuan.salah satu media yang digunakan untuk menyampaikan issue feminism adalah film. Film merupakan media massa yang dianggap efektif menyampaikan issue tentang pergerakan feminism yang dikemas kedalam sebuah cerita audio visual. Berkaca tentang pemahaman itulah, penulis mencoba melakukan penelitian dengan issue feminism. Penelitian ini membahas tentang feminisme dalam film Little Women karay Greta Gerwig yang dirilis pada tahu 2019 pada tokoh Jo dengan menggunaan teknik analisis wacana Sara Mills. Analisis wacana Sara Mills sendiri fokus pada bagaimana posisi-posisi antar tokoh dalam teks yakni melalu posisi subjek-objek. Kemudian terdapat juga posisi pembaca yang lebih menekankan bagaimana pembaca atau penonton bisa mengidentifikasi dan menempatkan dirinya dalam cerita. Metode kualitatif digunakan sebagai pendekatan penelitian. Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan mengambil data secara observasi, dan studi literatur. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukan adanya karakter Jo sebagai posisi subjek serta karakter Beth dan Mr. Dashwood sebagai objek, Dimana, apa yang dilakukan Jo merupakan bagian dari feminism posmodern yanga dinyatakan Cixous bahwa perempuan berhak dan dapat merenungkan apapun yang diinginkan tentang dirinya yang selama ini belum tersuarakan ke ranah publik. Hal tersebut menjaid kontradiktif ketika mengingat stigma tentang perempuan yang berkembang dimasyarakat pada saat itu. Dimana sebenarnya wanita memiliki kebebasan untuk menentukan apapun tentang dirinya. Serta kesetaraakn atau keadilan anatar perempuan dan laki-laki dapat tercipta dari ???perbedaa??? itu sendiri. Kemudian untuk posisi pembaca/penonton ditempatkan untuk bisa merasakan posisi Meg, Amy, Jo, dan Beth yang tetap memiliki prinsip kebebasan mendefinisikan diri di tengah ingkungan yang marginalkan kaum perempuan"

Good marketers are required to create the marketing communication program with the biggest impact which can happen if marketeers create customer experience in the program. Through customer experience, an engagement between the brand and the customer is created. Customer experience is achievable through meaningful exposure to aspects of the program, and through human five senses, namely, taste, touch, smell, hearing, and sight. This study focuses on the 7th Indonesia Sharia Economic Festival (ISEF) interactive website, by the Central Bank of Indonesia. ISEF has the most complete virtual features that engage visitors to the site and to date, it has achieved more than 29898 website visitors. The interactive website is designed with several Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, and Exhibitions (MICE) features such as lobby, exhibition, international showcase, conference & forum, international and domestic webinar, talkshow, workshop & business coaching, business matching, cultural program, lounge, and fashion show. This research explains how multisensory effect is felt by customers when they access the 7th ISEF website. Data analyzed for the study were extracted from several resources, namely, websites (features), journals and books. From analysis, the results indicate that although the 7th ISEF is implemented online, the website can still present all multisensory effects needed for customers to engage and develop their experience on. These led to the conclusion that interactive website has engagement capabilities equivalent to other offline event activities by displaying virtual tour features that help create the real exhibition ambience and experience for customers who visit the site.

We demonstrate the performance of an EAG with a reduction chamber that consists of a neutralizer. The ion produced by the neutralizer is characterized by measuring its ion properties utilizing an ion counter, a Faraday cup electrometer, and a mini-cyDMA. Both the SMAC and NTCC have balanced bipolar ions with ion concentration ratios of 0.95 and 1.07, respectively. While the diffusivity of the positive ions produced by the NTCC is more significant than that of the SMAC, it is the opposite for negative ions. The EAG system is evaluated by optimizing the EAG orifice diameter and carrier airflow rate. It was found that a maximum singly charged electrosprayed particle could be achieved at an orifice diameter and a carrier airflow rate of 10 mm and 1 L min-1, respectively. The performance of charge reduction is determined by a multiply to singly charged ratio. The NTCC neutralizer dramatically reduced the highly charged electrosprayed particle to below 10 elementary charges. In brief, the result shows that the NTCC performs better than the SMAC in reducing multiply charged particles."

To determine the behavior of the Microgrid and the designed BMS in accordance with the desired specifications, a Hardware-inthe-Loop (HIL) Simulation has been designed using Simulink to model a DC Microgrid which consists of several sub-systems such as: An ideally designed generator and load as a tester, a bidirectional buck and boost converter with a PI controller, and a battery system equipped with a Switched Shunt Resistor Cell Balancing type, all controlled using the BMS algorithm implemented on Arduino. From the test results, it is found that HIL can communicate with good QoS on various inputs as long as the Arduino sample time meets. Then the PI controller with HIL was able to improve converter performance and also succeeded in controlling cell balancing with the efficiency of charging and idle modes of 99 and 99.4 respectively. Finally, in testing the integrated system, the BMS can maintain the performance of the Microgrid with bus voltage and battery current parameters in various SoC conditions and generator voltage fluctuations, even though there are high voltage transients"

Therefore, several conditions need to be considered, namely the pH value of the water, the value of the nutrient solution, and the circulating water pump. Manually controlling water and environmental conditions will consume a lot of time and energy and is susceptible to human measurement errors. So it is necessary to design an integrated control system on hydroponic plants, including a water pH control system and a nutrient solution control system. This system uses several components, including a pH sensor, EC (Electrical Conductivity) sensor, Mega 2560 Pro as a microcontroller, a 4V 5 channel relay, and a peristaltic pump as an actuator that will move to remove pH-up, pH-down, and AB-mix nutrients. . This system is also based on the Internet of Things (IoT), where data obtained from pH sensors and EC sensors will be processed by a microcontroller and then sent to the IoT Antares platform via the available communication modules. Data is stored on Antares's cloud server to be displayed in a User Interface to the user. Based on the test results, the monitoring and integrated control systems for hydroponic plants have been successfully created and run well. The accuracy of the pH sensor is 99.99 , and the EC sensor is 99.93 . From the response time characteristics of the pH control system, the rise time is 2.5 minutes, the peak time is 5 minutes, the maximum overshoot is 131.53 , the settling time is 16 minutes, and the steady-state error value is 109.90 .

The dependency relations refer to evolutionary requirements. The technique uses natural language processing to extract dependency relations. This research analyzes how to obtain feature extractions by including the following: 1)Gathering requirements statement from the SRS document, 2)Identifying dependencies between requirements, 3)Developing interdependency extraction methods and, 4) Modeling of the interdependency requirement. The expectation of this experiment indicates the interdependency graph model. This graph defines the interdependency in the (Software Requirement Specification) SRS document. This method gathers interdependency between SRS document requirements such as PART OF, AND, OR, & XOR. Therefore, getting the feature extraction to identify the interdependency requirement will be useful for solving specified requirements changing."

One way to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative from an opinion can be solved by sentiment analysis. However, analyzing sentiment manually is difficult due to a large amount of data, so it is necessary to implement automation that can make this easier. In this research, we investigate a machine learning method for classifying movie review sentiment. Then Ensemble Stacking model was chosen as a classification method for this sentiment analysis case. In the classification stage, three algorithms (Na??ve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression) are implemented as the base-learners, then the Logistic Regression algorithm is implemented as a meta-classifier to improve the performance of the base-learners in the Ensemble Stacking model. Therefore, testing and comparison between single classification such as the base-learners with the classification method using Ensemble Stacking are the main focus of this research. The results of this research show that the accuracy of this stacking model reaches 89.40 , an increase of 0.71 from the highest accuracy on the base-learners."

Phaser 3 is a popular HTML5 based game framework on the browser platform. However, Phaser 3 does not facilitate managing code of User Interface (UI) event component. Sometimes a game developer discovers that UI event component codes, such as buttons or joysticks that have been created, must be regenerated on subsequent projects with the same function. In this research, we proposed a reusability framework for Phaser 3 by combining the factory method and the singleton pattern in managing UI event components. The aim is to make developer productivity increased so that there is no need to repeat the algorithm or code that has been created previously. Our results show that the Phaser 3 UI standard has less a reusability value of 64,241 , while the proposed framework that was built has relatively higher reusability, that is equal to 84,576 . Game developers can add the combination of design patterns, as good software development practices, into an existing game framework to achieve code reusability without major changing on the existing game framework. This approach can also be used for the creators of game framework to use design patterns from the outset of development of game framework."

At that level, the children have not been able to receive and convey information properly. Therefore, communication between the teacher and the parent is needed so that school information and children's personal information can be appropriately shared. One private elementary school in Indonesia uses communication books and WhatsApp as communication media for the teacher and parent. However, this media causes several problems, such as forgetting to check communication books to miss a lot of information. The number of messages on Whatsapp causes the information to go deep, so teachers and parents must scroll continuously to get information. From these problems, a communication media with a good user experience value is needed in conveying information so that the communication process between the teacher and parent can run better. We use the Goal-Directed Design (GDD) method in designing communication media because GDD can identify each stakeholder's different roles, characteristics, abilities, and needs. The communication model prototype is tested using the USE Questionnaire, Maze Design, follow-up interview, and observation. From the USE Questionnaire results obtained, the percentage results above 87 percent for each tested usability aspect. These results are obtained because the target user is delighted and helped by the communication media features such as categorization of school information, provision of information templates, and repeated reminders to check information. We have also added features based on follow-up interviews, namely school information categories by month and daily study summary information, due to the changing learning system caused by the COVID 19 pandemic."

Therefore, the micro and macro factors influencing employee ecological behaviour (EEB) are a rising interest among researchers. The contemporary concept of EEB has been embraced by many organisations and attracted scholars??? attention worldwide. Nevertheless, studies that explored challenges and solutions for performing EEB at the workplace are scarce. This study explored challenges and solutions in performing EEB at the workplace and focused on qualitative research methodology. The researchers interviewed 24 academicians from five leading green research Malaysian universities. Valuable qualitative data and numerous challenges such as high costs of practising, lack of infrastructure, top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as challenges in applying EEB from the interviews. Stringent rules and regulations, monitoring, training programmes, and monetary incentives might be efficient solutions to apply ecological behaviour at workplaces, specifically universities. In conclusion, this study has discovered the challenges and solutions in implementing EEB for a sustainable workplace by interviewing academicians from different departments of selected Malaysian higher educational institutes. Also, poor infrastructure, high cost, and the lack of top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as the primary challenges in performing EEB.

It is considered as a great tool to achieve competitive advantages and add positive value either for them and their shareholders. Especially in today???s business environment which characterized by increasing demands, more changes, and complexity. This is mostly true for businesses with communication, information, and technological background. Our study investigated the role of effective leaders and the employee's readiness in shaping the organization's agility. also, we study the moderation effect of job level in the relationship. We collected the data using an online questionnaire distributed to the chosen business area (Regional Division II) and get 584 useable responses in two months. Our sample consists of various job levels from the lowest to the highest. We apply multiple regression using Macro Process and SPSS to analyze the data. The effective leadership style proved to have a positive and significant impact on the organization???s agility. and employee readiness played a significant role as mediator. The moderated mediation effect is also significant since there is no zero value in the confidence interval. However, the moderator (job level) only has an influence on the link between the employee readiness and organization agility. Regarding the conditional indirect effect, it was found significant in the lower, average, and higher job level. Business practitioners and academics need to understand agree that the level of agility in many organizations needs to be upgraded. The uncertain and turbulent situation needs an agile organization, thus the manager needs to focus on important factors that drive the agility. This research provides evidence that effective leadership and employee readiness can help to create agile organizations."

The fierce competition between companies to attract promising talents has never been easy. Identifying prospective job applicants through a personality measuring ontology model is possible through the digital trace left by prospective talents in social media. The recent development of the ontology model based on the Big Five Personality theory with the addition of 2399 corpus ontologies resulted in more accurate and diverse personality analysis. Thus, we propose to analyze talent personality faster and cheaper using large-scale social media textual data posts. For the experiment, we examine 5 Twitter accounts of employees selected by a company A HR department. We measure employee personality using 3744 Twitter posts. This research succeeded in mapping different dominant personalities such as Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness from job applicants.

The number of aircraft movements at Soekarno Hatta airport increased from 2017 to 2019, reaching over 390.000 aircraft per year. As a result, parking stands in the apron area are congested, pushing some aircraft to park in lots not part of the plans. The quality of service provided will degrade if the number of aircraft operating exceeds the airport's capacity. So it is necessary to optimize the Parking Stand or Apron Capacity. The authors used a dataset of 227526 aircraft parking data records to determine the highest capacity of parking stand compositions, which was determined by three variables that are the number of parking stands, aircraft share population, and average stand occupancy time in specific aircraft groups. According to the dataset processing with Restricted Stand Use Strategy, the apron's maximum capacity is 6,336 aircraft per hour, with 23 parking stands available per hour. Apron capacity optimization is calculated using three different scenarios that are changing the number of parking stands, the average stand occupancy time, and the share population. The average stand occupancy time is the primary reference for optimization among the three variables that produce the most significant capacity value. With optimization performed on the Garuda Narrow Body aircraft group, the apron capacity of 15,652 aircraft per hour is obtained using the FAA's stand occupancy time recommendation of 35-60 minutes."

However, transaction data generated by the system has not been utilized properly, especially in the context of determining seat availability planning policies. Coupled with the unavailability of the load factor analysis is an obstacle in carrying out such planning. Based on data from the Bus Management System, two variables can be used as independent variables to calculate the load factor, namely, the total number of passengers boarding a bus and the total availability of seats based on the movement of the bus out of the airport and the seating capacity of each bus used. This research will use the Monte Carlo simulation method in creating an ideal load factor model in the future. Load Factor can be optimized using the data analytics approach through the monte carlo simulation method. Based on the simulation results that have been carried out in this study, it can be seen that the prediction model achieved has similarities in the demand movement trend pattern between historical data records and simulation data. Based on the predicted value of the resulting demand, it can be done to plan the availability of seats following the predicted demand so that the load factor to be achieved can reach the optimal percentage."

In this study, a method for detecting seizures in epi-leptic EEG is proposed using analysis of the distribution of the signal spectrum in the time range t. The EEG signal, which includes normal, inter-ictal, and ictal, is transformed into the time-frequency domain using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To find the highest detection accura-cy, simulations were carried out on varying window length, overlap, and FFT points. The frequency distribution and first-order statistics were then calculated as feature vectors for the classification process. A support vector machine was employed to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation results showed the highest accuracy of 92.3 using 25-20-512 STFT and quadratic SVM.

MCI detection was needed to determine the patient's therapeutic management. Power spectral analysis of the EEG signal was commonly used to observe changes in functionality associated with MCI. Since the EEG signal contains a large amount of noise artifact, power analysis can generate bias, particularly at low frequencies. The artifacts were often mixed with a blink or eyeball movement noise. Therefore, in this study, the characterization of EEG coherence was carried out in MCI patients and normal subjects to overcome this problem. The hypothesis was that the EEG coherence might give different values to be considered as a modality in MCI detection. EEG recording from 11 MCI patients and 16 normal elderly subjects were investigated. This study investigated the inter and intra-hemispheric coherence over 16 EEG channels in the frequency range of 1-30 Hz.

Currently, diagnosis and evaluation are carried out using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis, which is performed visually by clinicians. Since EEG signals tend to be random and non-stationary, the visual inspection often provides misrepresentation of results. Numerous studies have been proposed computer-based analysis for epileptic EEG classification; however, there is still a gap to improve detection accuracy with a small number of features. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an automatic detection protocol for epileptic EEG classification. The proposed methods are relative wavelet energy and wavelet entropy for feature extraction and combined with the classifier method for automatic detection. In this study, three classes of EEG consisted of pre-ictal, ictal, and interictal were used as test data and also evaluate the proposed method. EEG signals were decomposed using wavelet transform into five conventional sub-bands, including gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta. The relative energy and entropy were then calculated in each of these bands as a feature set. These methods are chosen with consider of low-cost computing. We tested the performance of our feature extraction method using Support Vector Machine (SVM), both linear and non-linear kernels. From the simulation, the highest accuracy was 80-96.7 for ictal vs. pre-ictal, ictal vs. inter-ictal, pre-ictal vs. inter-ictal, and ictal vs. non-ictal. Finally, this work was expected to help clinicians in the detection of epilepsy onset based on EEG signals."

In Indonesia, Bandung in particular, many people still keep clean water supplies in water tanks. The habit appeared as the result of their dependency on groundwater. However, some people also have already been connected to the government's water pipeline network, but they still need to have clean water tanks for prevention. The tanks need regular maintenances to ensure the stored water remains clean. When the tanks are rarely cleaned, moss appears, which can clog the water pipe. The manual process of monitoring water conditions has several weaknesses, such as needing expert staff, taking more extended time, having a greater possibility of errors, and not presenting and neatly storing documentations. This paper discusses the implementation of a water turbidity warning system in tanks and an IoT-based scheduling system for cleaning water tanks. The system will be implemented at several points of the house or water tank and can transmit data in real-time either alternately or simultaneously. The sensor detects water turbidity, and the MCU Node is in charge of processing the sensor reading data to be calibrated and classified the turbidity level. Water turbidity values and levels are sent to Firebase, which resides in the cloud. The information from Firebase is passed and displayed on the application. The turbidity level of water was categorized into three, namely: clean, turbid, and dirty. Managers, as the service providers, and consumers can monitor the tank's condition with a warning in the form of an indicator when the tank must be cleaned."

The change in path characteristics is caused by the distance and multipath fading between the transmitter and receiver so that the amplitude and phase of the received signal varies over time. As a result, the performance of the routing algorithm in determining uncertain communication paths causes a significant decrease in throughput. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate fading rate and the frequency of the fading signal, which is below a threshold. This mechanism is known as the Level Crossing Rate (LCR). In this paper, we propose the level crossing rate as a novel metric model approach for routing in multipath fading environments to determine the communication path. We have also created a model for estimating throughput based on the level crossing rate. We evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed method to that of a routing model that uses the shortest path algorithm (SPA) and channel quality (CQ) aware routing that employs average signal-to-noise ratio (ASNR) and average power connection (APC) as the metric. The simulation result shows that the proposed LCR routing model outperforms than another routing model that applies SPA, ASNR, and APC."

This paper proposes spatial diversity implementation for obtaining more accurate hand gesture features to cope with this problem. Array radar was selected as a sensor configuration to create the spatial diversity feature. In this paper, an array configuration of four Continuous Wave (CW) radars is proposed as a contactless sensor for hand gestures. Peak detection based on cross-correlation was employed to determine the time position of the hand gesture Doppler response detected by each CW radar. The time position pattern then becomes a feature of each hand gesture used. The CW radar array is realized with an operating frequency of 10 GHz by using the HB 100 as a CW radar component. The experimental results show that the proposed method can distinguish the hand gesture feature with an accuracy of 96.6 at a sensing distance of 50 cm.

The increasing density of data traffic leads to an increase in the demand for telecommunication services. Therefore, in this study, the LTE network expansion was carried out using a choice of frequencies of 700 MHz, 2100 MHz, and 2300 MHz. The analysis was carried out from the technical, economic, and sensitivity aspects. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the minimum ARPU for each candidate frequency. This research was conducted using a case study of the city of Yogyakarta. Based on the simulation results, the average RSRP values for the three candidate frequencies are in the very good range. The SINR values for the three candidate frequencies are in the normal category and the throughput values are in the very good category. The techno-economic calculations of IRR, NPV and payback period for the frequencies of 2100 MHz and 2300 are included in a feasible business, while at a frequency of 700 MHz it is not feasible to do so. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the frequency of 2300 MHz is a feasible frequency to be implemented for LTE networks with the minimum ARPU and the minimum number of users.

The QoS aims to provide better network service by allocating service application traffic resources to an excellent user experience. The purpose makes QoS capability very important in regulating the technical specifications for XGS-PON equipment in Indonesia. In its implementation, XGS-PON supports several types of mechanisms and techniques to provide QoS, such as scheduling mechanisms for 802.1p and Differentiated service (DiffServ). This study evaluates the implementation of 802.1p and DiffServ in traffic handling to support QoS in the network. Its main scope is the ability of XGS-PON to control how much bandwidth is in the network, how it is treated, and how classes can use based on Weight Round Robin (WRR) and Strict Priority (SP) priorities. In addition, XGS-PON must also map DiffServ to 802.1p priority along with the service class attributes it carries. Performance evaluation is carried out by introducing a test method for the traffic handling mechanism on 802.1p and DiffServ. The test results show that XGS-PON can control traffic with the highest and lowest priority to pass bandwidth with a value of 10\ and 40\ of the amount of traffic that has been set. In addition, XGS-PON can manage to pass 100\ bandwidth only at the highest or lowest priority. The results of the DiffServ capability test show that XGS-PON can map eight types of service classes (BE, AF11, CS2-7) into eight 802.1p priorities. Thus, XGS-PON can QoS traffic handling mechanism 802.1p and DiffServ following the recommendations of the Technical Report Broadband Forum and can be implemented in regulations and standardization in Indonesia."

An array of ring resonators in symmetrical shape used as the basis of AMC structure is designed to absorb the incoming EM waves at a certain operating frequency. The proposed design of wave absorber made of ring resonator-based AMC structure is deployed on a Flame Retardant (FR) 4 Epoxy dielectric substrate with the thickness of 1.6 mm. The shape and dimension of ring resonator are optimized to work at the certain operating frequency using a unit cell with proper boundary conditions. To investigate the absorptivity rate of proposed wave absorber, resistive elements are incorporated into the ring resonator. Here, the experimental measurement aims to verify the realized wave absorber with the proposed design and to measure the absorptivity characteristics of realized wave absorber. The measured results for the realized wave absorber which takes the dimension of 220 mm ?? 220 mm have the absorptivity rate, in terms of reflection coefficient (S11), of ???16.65 dB and ???25.72 dB for the wave absorber without and with resistors, respectively.

The results of measuring the LTE network's quality show that there are 8 Bad Spot areas with an average value of the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) parameter of -100.39 dBm, the Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) parameter of 4.50 dB, and the Throughput parameter of 3.92 Mbps. These parameter values still do not meet the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) standards of an operator. To overcome the problem of low RSRP, SINR, and Throughput parameter values, the method used is to use improvements in coverage terms. This method's approach is done by changing some transmitter parameter values, using the physical tunning method such as mechanical tilting, changes in azimuth patterns, and adjusts the antenna height. The next method is power configuration or setting the transmit power on a transmitter. The standard operator KPI thresholds for RSRP parameters are greater than -91 dBm, SINR greater than 16 dB and Throughput greater than 12 Mbps. By making improvements to the 8 Bad Spot points, the results of the parameter values that meet the operator's KPI with the average RSRP parameter after repair are -89.95 dBm, SINR parameter is 16.83 dB, and throughput parameter is 37.42 Mbps."

This research specifically examines the store interior of the Mothercare brand, which is a retail store that provides all the special needs of pregnant women, babies and children. The choice of the brand is because Mothercare is the number one global retailer in the market for pregnant women, babies and children. This research focuses on the corridor of the display section of baby products and pregnant women. This is because the dimensions of the corridor width are not in accordance with human standards in general, especially for visitors to pregnant women who have expanded personal space.

However, in its implementation, there are various kinds of obstacles that have an impact on the lack of effectiveness and efficiency of the system, in terms of time, material and human resources. This study aims to evaluate existing business processes and design, and implement the results of business process re-engineering (BPR) in the official trip system which is supported by digitization and digitalization with a multi-unit integration approach at one of the private universities in Indonesia, Telkom University. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-method with an embedded design approach. The quantitative method was carried out by calculating the performance of official trip procedures before and after the BPR. Meanwhile, the qualitative method was carried out by conducting interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with key informants in this study. Triangulation technique was used to validate the research results. Findings: The BPR process has resulted in radical changes to the official trip system at the university, namely from a mixed system of manual/offline & online to completely online, from a very centralized to decentralized decision process, and the availability of a transparent monitoring system. These changes provide significant results by increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes so as to speed up time, save paper (reduce paper waste and reduce costs) and optimize employee assignments. Originality/value: This study adds new insights into the implementation of BPR to the official trip system in higher education. This research implies that BPR can produce radical changes in business processes in higher education to become more effective and efficient. In addition, this study proposes several practical and academically useful recommendations for further research in this area."

The world is currently experiencing rapid technological developments in all fields, including the gaming industry. This trend has resulted in more and more people focusing on the massive use of online games to distract them and focus, especially during the pandemic. The massive use of online games, or often referred to as internet gaming disorder (IGD), especially in Generation Z, has attracted many researchers around the world. Fast consumptive behavior and uncontrolled behavior are considered to bring harm to these online gamers. Furthermore, the integration of E-money in the game platform is expected to increase the flexibility of the consumptive behavior of these online gamers, thereby increasing the risk of IGD for these gamers. We used an online questionnaire that was tested on 155 respondents and thus analyzed the results by SEM-PLS. This study is unique because to the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the mediating effect of self-control on the integration of perceived ease of use of electronic money on consumptive behavior on the level of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) Generation Z. The empirical contribution of this study thus recommends the need to mediate control to these Generation Z gamers to suppress the tendency of rapid consumptive behavior and reduce the potential risk of developing Internet Gaming Disorder (emergency room).

There is a common perception among people in developing countries that imported products are of much better quality than local products. Purpose - Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory, this study attempts to examine a structural model that contains the relationship between Product Quality (Stimulus) and Purchase Intention (Response), involving Trust and Emotional Values (Organism) as intervening variables. Design/Methodology/Approach - The authors collected data through a survey of consumers. In total there are 180 questionnaires that have been filled out and can be used for data processing. Subsequently, an examination of the proposed hypotheses was carried out using the Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, assisted by WarpPLS 5.0 software. Findings - The results of the study indicate that there is a significant influence on the relationship between Product Quality and Purchase Intention, which in turn, Product Quality also significantly influences consumer Trust and Emotional Value. In addition, this study also found that consumer Trust and consumer Emotional Value were able to significantly mediate the relationship between Product Quality and Purchase Intention. Research Limitations - This study discusses consumer Purchase Intention in local electronic products in Indonesia. However, this research also has some limitations. First, this research was conducted in the context of electronic products only, where this could be an obstacle to generalizing consumer intention in non-electronic local products. Second, the data in this study were obtained through a cross-sectional design only. For this reason, it is necessary to replicate similar research in order to obtain comprehensive and generalizable research results. Originality/Value - This study shows the importance of the impact of product quality, trust, and emotional value, in influencing consumer purchase intention. To the best of our knowledge, this framework has never been studied before. This research will add value to the related literature by filling the gap of previous research and also will provide practical implications for the local manufacturers to maintain their product quality, in order to increase consumer trust, emotional value, and purchase intention.

The development and usage of traditional statistical predicting models, which require the understanding of underlying physical scientific processes in a system and large amounts of data preparation, can be challenging and costly. Artificial intelligence-based models, specifically machine learning models, are able to easily review mass data volumes and identify complex data trends to make predictions, making them beneficial to be utilized as prediction models. Terengganu, located on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, has experienced three earthquakes in the last four decades and has the potential to be hit or affected by earthquakes due to its location within the vicinity of the South China Sea where the seismologically active Manila Trench is situated. This makes the development of machine learning models for the prediction of earthquakes in Terengganu important for future disaster analysis and management. Therefore, this study suggests artificial neural network (ANN) models as a tool to predict ground motion parameters, namely earthquake acceleration, depth, and velocity, in Terengganu. However, this study presents the comparison of the results of ANN with the results of Random Forest (RF). The data used to develop the models were collected by six seismological stations for two channels in Terengganu and provided by the Malaysian Meteorological Department. The data was partitioned into six sets for each ground motion parameter in each channel, with each set utilizing data from a different grouping of five stations for training and one station for testing. Earthquake depth was able to be modelled with accuracy univariately, that is using only the respective output parameter, which is earthquake depth, as the input parameter. Earthquake acceleration and velocity could not be modelled with accuracy univariately, and were improved by adding earthquake depth as an input parameter. Based on the analysis and evaluation of the results using four selected performance criteria, the ANN models show good performance in predicting earthquake acceleration, depth, and velocity."

We show that in addition to the inherent off-axis aberrations that occur due to the hyperbolic phase profile of the metasurface, the focusing performance is significantly degraded due to the meta-atoms??? angular dispersion. To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance, point-dipole models are used which incorporate different aspects of the meta-atoms??? angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident angles. The modelling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the experimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms is the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations."

Shrimp is one of the major export and import commodities. Vanname shrimp (Litopenaeus Vannamei) is one of the most popular shrimp farms in Indonesia. Poor water quality (dissolved oxygen content) can cause the Vanname shrimp affected by diseases such as white defecation. This disease causes Vanname shrimp to lose appetite, which results in slow growth. To prevent the lack of oxygen problem, one needs a waterwheel to maintain oxygen levels properly. The authors designed a tool to detect waterwheel conditions by monitoring the electric current on waterwheels in IoT-based shrimp ponds. The system uses Arduino for sensor data acquisition, Raspberry Pi to send data to IoT platform, INA219 sensor to measure current value and voltage on the waterwheel.

Masalah lain adalah keandalan listrik atau gangguan terputusnya saluran dan drop tegangan, serta sistem penerangan gerbang depan serta penerangan bilik di pesantren belum memadai. Untuk membantu meringankan biaya bulanan dan meningkatkan keandalan kelistrikan, maka dipasang Pembangkit Lisrik Tenaga Surya (PLTS). Sistem tersebut meliputi panel sel surya (gabungan beberapa modul sel surya), baterai, inverter, monitoring-kontroler, saklar, stop kontak, sensor photocell, dan pelengkap lainnya. Panel sel surya akan mengalirkan energi menuju baterai pada siang hari, pada malam hari lampu dapat dinyalakan secara otomatis maupun manual. Power House atau Pusat Daya PLTS akan dipasang di bangunan utama pondok pesantren, sehigga pemantauan PLTS akan lebih mudah."

This study aims to design a converter for photovoltaic based on FuzzyMPPT. The system is evaluated under conditions of under partial shading. In the test, the F-MPPT charge controller was able to produce an average power efficiency of 88 under Partial Shading Condition (PSC) conditions with a maximum power of 33.1 Watt and 30.25 Watt PV. The average efficiency is 89 when the Voutput limit is given, this is done to adjust the battery charging voltage level so as not to damage the power storage components during the charging process."

Many algorithms have been applied to achieve high performance for the classification of EEG epilepsy. However, the complexity and randomness of EEG signals is a challenge for researchers to apply the appropriate algorithm. In this research, fractal analysis of EEG signals is expected to be able to distinguish EEG signals in seizure, no seizure, and normal conditions.

During the dry season, farmers oftentimes use groundwater for irrigation. Water pumps that are commonly used when taking groundwater are typically powered by diesel or electrical grid from PLN. However, the long distance between energy sources and water pumps for irrigating rice fields is one of the obstacles in Mauk Village. Therefore, this study aims to design and implement a solar powered water pump for irrigation. Based on the research results, the 50 WP solar powered water pump can operate in sunny, overcast, and cloudy weather. The low intensity of solar radiation on cloudy days causes the irrigation time to be longer than sunny days. This is because the power output of the off grid solar power system is strongly influenced by the test weather conditions. In sunny conditions, the highest power resulted was 33.01 Watt, while in cloudy and overcast conditions the maximum power obtained was only 27.60 Watt and 24.34 Watt respectively. The output power of the solar panel also affects the amount of battery SOC that can be charged, the greater the power generated, the higher the percentage of the battery SOC. In addition, the cost savings for solar powered pumps equal to more than 90 compared to diesel water pumps."

Pulmonary crackles of discontinuous short duration appear on inspiration, expiration, or both. To differentiate these pulmonary crackles, the medical staff usually uses a manual method, called auscultation. Various methods were developed to recognize pulmonary crackles and distinguish them from normal pulmonary sounds to be applied in digital signal processing technology. This paper demonstrates a feature extraction method to classify pulmonary crackle and normal lung sounds using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method using several kernels by performing spectrograms of the pulmonary sound to generate the frequency profile. Spectrograms with various resolutions and 3-fold cross-validation were used to divide the training data and the test data in the testing process. The resulting accuracy ranges from 81.4 - 100 . More accuracy values of 100 are generated by a feature extraction in several SVM kernels using 256 points FFT with three variations of windowing parameters compared to 512 points, where the best accuracy of 100 was produced by STFT-SVM method. This method has a potential to be used in the classification of other biomedical signals. The advantages of that are that the number of features produced is the same as the N-point FFT used for any signal length, the flexibility in the STFT parameters changes, such as the type of window and the window's length. In this study, only the Keiser window was tested with specific parameters. Exploration with different window types with various parameters is fascinating to do in further research."

Therefore, it is the main objective of this research to learn the best practice of the farming side for a living pharmacy and to design a smart farming system that is suitable to grow these local medicinal plants specifically to cater not only for the farmers, but to the people who are also interested in growing their own medicinal plants that are suitable in a weather like Brunei Darussalam. In this research, a set of five different medicinal plants are chosen for the experiment. Two types of organic fertilizers are used to treat the plants, avoiding the use of chemical substances. Electronic sensors are used to monitor the soil condition and solar energy is used to power the sensors and the other electronic components within the automated monitoring and maintenance system of the plants. Wi-Fi application that allows users to monitor the data from the plants is also developed. Comparison between the effect of the two organic fertilizers to the plants growth and soil conditions are done. Measurement and analysis are presented in this paper."

Process mining is generally applied to analyse the event log of patient treatments as extracted from the Electronic Health Record (EHR). In this study, we proposed an approach to combine the event log of patient treatments with the clinical user access log of the hospital information system to analyse system usage during patient treatments. Our case study combined an event log of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatments in the Leeds Cancer Centre with the user access log in the hospital information system. The event log of patient records during chemotherapy was extracted from the EHR system. The clinical user access log was extracted from the Splunk web-based log management system in the hospital. Combining records from those two logs has been useful to provide information on system usage during patient treatment. Our experiment focused on the GPTab, a functionality that allows clinicians during consultations to check on patient records on their GP visits. We applied both statistical and clinical evaluations to ensure that the findings are statistically correct and clinically meaningful. We captured the phenomena of the decreasing number of patients on the subsequent cycles of chemotherapy and when GPTab has been used during the course of chemotherapy. This approach is potentially useful for general cases to analyse system usage during process execution and can be applied to investigate the effects of system changes to process executions."

A single connectivity enables handover between 5G base stations. Meanwhile, a dual connectivity is a handover that occurs from a 4G base station to a 5G base station. In sending data, TCP has a congestion control algorithm that allows TCP to handle congestion problems on the network. In this study, we analysed the performance of HMIPv6 using TCP YeAH and TCP CUBIC with varying User Equipment (UE) speeds using Network Simulator-3 (NS-3). It showed that each TCP has a fairly stable delay and throughput under the condition of the Single Connectivity handover with an average delay of 192.8196 ms and average throughput of 52.8812 Mbps. Whereas in the Dual Connectivity handover condition, each TCP has a fluctuating delay and throughput that is directly proportional to the increasing UE speed. Therefore TCP YeAH dominates the stability in Dual Connectivity with an average delay of 221.4226 ms and average throughput of 44.4004 Mbps. Overall, this study found that TCP YeAH performed better than TCP CUBIC in both the Single Connectivity and Dual Connectivity handovers."

Due to uncover the previous business process, Company X is going to build the new factory to coffee processing. Since the project has not been started, it is recommended to produce risk management plan in earlier stage of project. The process used in this research is identifying risk, performance qualitative risk analysis, and risk response plan, according to PMBOK 6 edition. In this research, WBS is used as input to identify risk which is processed into risk register and thereafter becomes probability and impact matrix. It is necessary to know the response or action that can be done. The result obtained from this research is risk register for coffee plant construction project which earned more than 43 risk. There are only 2 risks which sit on red level (high risk) and 3 risk which sit on orange level (medium risk). The most dangerous risk within this project is Project permit to start the work order has not been issued yet, wrong estimation on project budgeting. The first dangerous risk is triggered by poor stakeholder management plan while the second risk is triggered by poor site survey. The medium risks are commonly triggered by quality issue thus quality metric is suggested as risk response."

A simulation approach with three developed scenarios is used in the paper. The first utilised the standard deviation of skewed performance scores, the second applied the standard deviation of normalised data, and the third practised a percentile approach. Concerning the normalisation process of employee performance data, the paper proposed a weighted function to address skewness. The results indicate that the process of identifying talent using a nine-grid box is sensitive to changes in the classification criteria used, indicating a bias in identifying talent. In sum, using a standard deviation approach using transformation data is the most appropriate choice for use in performance data with a skewed distribution. The Government of West Java Province, Indonesia, can use the simulation results to objectively identify excellent civil servants and develop an appropriate TM strategy. A similar process treatment can be implemented in other organisations that have skew distribution issues. This paper introduces a weighted function approach to address practical problems in the unsymmetrical distribution of employee performance scores when identifying talent using a TM framework. It shows the application of a unique mathematical technique to solve issues found in the field of human resources management systems."

CPO is a staple of human life so there is a need for a technique to increase the business. one of the things that can be forecasted from CPO is the price of CPO. By using the times series, it is possible to predict CPO prices. The accuracy measurement that can be used is MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for forecasting. In the test, the time series data used is the average monthly yield of CPO prices starting from December 2010 to April 2021 as many as 125 data. In this article, we tested 60 of the training data and 40 of the test data, and the MAPE obtained was 0.03463929 , and the MAPE obtained with 80 of the training data and 20 of the test data was 0.04392103 . The result of MAPE does not seem that much different so that it can be tested in various other accuracy techniques."

The burning of fossil fuels to meet the industrial electricity demand is leading to deleterious environmental effects. Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is an optimization problem that determines an optimum way in terms of cost-effectiveness and emission minimization, for generating power by utilizing the electricity generation resources. Global climatic concerns are driving the researchers to spread the scope of ELD and include unconventional and renewable sources. This research work proposes a combination of three major renewable energy sources with thermal power sources (solar, wind and hydro). The proposed objective function includes a large number of major constraints related to each of the included sources which have not been combined before. The pattern search algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 40 unit test system combining wind, solar and hydro power generating units to observe the results. The results are also compared with the 140 unit Korean power generation model and in addition to several similar systems. Simulation results show that the problem formulation and inclusion of respective constraints bring authenticity to the system and produce accurate results"

The aim of this study is to optimize path for transportation networks with multiple intermediate sinks between an initial source and final sink. The presented problem is solved by developing a mathematical model using forward and backward recursive computations with objective to explore different modes of transportations for minimizing per unit cost to deliver raw material. The developed model is validated through a case study comprising rail, road and air as available transportation modes. Results of this case study show that rail mode has minimum distance (1475km) followed by mixed road-rail-air mode (1513km) and road mode (1527km). Talking about the cost to deliver one kilogram of material, the cost was minimum for train (0.3667 PKR), followed by road-rail-air (0.4335 PKR) and road (0.4668 PKR). However, decision can be taken on the basis of priorities such as cost, time, and due date. The outcomes of solving transportation problem with multiple sinks between an initial source and final sink can be used to optimize delivery of goods and services (courier, goods, medicines etc.)"

Participants consist of Gen Z that born between 1995-2010 and come from several regions. A survey towards 326 participants found that WhatsApp, Instagram, and YouTube are platforms that were used by Gen Z in their daily life. Meanwhile, this generation chose WhatsApp as the platform to share information on COVID-19 and other platforms like Instagram and Twitter to receive and post information, image, video, opinion, and personal experiences related to COVID-19. Findings also show that in daily life, the participants can be categorised as heavy users because they spent more than four hours a day to use digital media. In contrast, they only spent less than an hour per day to find and share information about COVID-19. Therefore, this study argues that there are differences of media preferences in daily life and toward information related to COVID-19."

One such dynamic change taken place in India is in the area of transport, especially rail travel application started by Indian Railways, namely, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) portal. Present paper tries to identify the reason why people consider the IRCTC application as the most reliable application. Model was proposed by adopting the factors from Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) along with an addition of perceived trust as an influencing factor. Data from 193 usable questionnaires was collected from Goa and were tested against the research model. Result indicated that habit, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and perceived trust were the main predictors of behavior intention to adopt and use IRCTC application. The proposed model was able to explain 65 variance on behavior intention. It was also found that income moderates the relationship between facilitating condition and behaviour intention. The study also provides valuable insight for the management to improve the IRCTC application in order to motivate customers to adopt and continuously use the services of this application."

The Case Investigation Information System (SIPP) is a service for the public that requires good integration of information so that legal services are provided quickly and easily. In 2020 court websites experienced many hacker attacks based on data from internal court sources, at least there were more than 20 courts throughout Indonesia that were affected by damage to both the website, the SIPP web feature, and the court library featured. Based on the Minister of Communication and Informatics Regulation No. 4 of 2016 in article 7, every SPBE organizer must implement information security following the information security standards described by the Ministry of Communication and Information. Since this regulation is conceived to minimize the risk of the security breach on SPBE, and there is such numerous security breach in 2020 therefore this indicates poor implementation of the regulation. Based on this finding this research aims to investigate which area is neglected. To achieve this, this research employs gap analysis using ISO/IEC 27001:2013and maturity level to reveal the neglected areas in information security. Current findings show there are SIPP users that still use weak passwords and lack of awareness of top management personnel in several information security areas such as securing sensitive documents or policies that regulate information security specifically for SIPP. These findings entail that the security management in Court is most likely at the initiative level."

Two common fruit recognition models include bag-of-features (BoF) and convolutional neural network (ConvNet), which achieve high-performance results. In most cases, the overfitting problem is unavoidable. This problem makes it difficult to generalize new instances with only a slightly different appearance, although belonging to the same category. This article proposes a new fruit recognition model by associating an object's low-level features in an image with a high-level concept. We define a perceptual color for each fruit species to construct a relationship between fruit color and semantic color name. Furthermore, we develop our model by integrating the perceptual color and semantic template concept to solve the overfitting problem. The semantic template concept as a mapping between the high-level concept and the low-level visual feature is adopted in this model. The experiment was conducted on three different fruit image datasets, with one dataset as train data and the two others as test data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, called perceptual color on semantic template (PCoST), is significantly better than the BoF and ConvNet models in reducing the overfitting problem."

The grading process is conducted manually by visual observations of workers which tend to be subjective and ineffective. Some corn seed factories use sieve machines to do grading by seed size. In this paper, an imaging-based classification system is proposed to perform corn seeds (BIMA- 20) grading of two classes, which are categorised as good and bad. Three different methods are studied in the paper. The methods are respectively based on (1) shape, colour, and size features, (2) seed roundness, and (3) deep learning approach. Images data is acquired in group of five corn kernels. Regionof-interest (ROI) segmentation is performed to select each single seed from the group image.

It is one of the essential components of speech synthesis, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The deep learning (DL)-based state-of-the-art G2P model generally gives low phoneme error rate (PER) as well as word error rate (WER) for high-resource languages, such as English and European, but not for low-resource languages. Therefore, some conventional machine learning (ML)-based G2P models incorporated with specific linguistic knowledge are preferable for low-resource languages. However, these models are poor for several low-resource languages because of various issues. For instance, an Indonesian G2P model works well for roots but gives a high PER for derivatives. Most errors come from the ambiguities of some roots and derivative words containing four prefixes: , , , and . In this research, an Indonesian G2P model based on n-gram combined with stemmer and phonotactic rules (NGTSP) is proposed to solve those problems. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation, using 50 k Indonesian words, informs that the proposed NGTSP gives a much lower PER of 0.78 than the state-of-the-art Transformer-based G2P model (1.14 ). Besides, it also provides a much faster processing time."

Firstly, the population is split into two sub-populations based on their qualities: high and low, with a particular portion that can be simply tuned depending on the given problem. The high-quality sub-population searches for an optimum solution in an exploitative manner using a movement scheme used in the Rao-3 algorithm. Meanwhile, the low-quality one does in an explorative fashion using a new random walk. Secondly, two evolutionary operators: crossover and mutation, are exploited to make the proposed ERA faster in the exploitative and explorative searching, respectively. Here, both operators are implemented using a random scheme with the common probabilistic values so that they do not create any additional parameters. Examination of the twenty-three benchmark functions: seven unimodal, six multimodal, and ten low-dimension multimodal shows that the proposed ERA outperforms the three original Rao algorithms. A detailed investigation indicates that both introduced schemes work very well to make the ERA evolves faster in an exploitative manner, which is created by a high portion of high-quality individuals and the crossover operator, and avoids trapping on the local optimum solutions in an explorative manner, which is created by a high portion of low-quality individuals and the mutation operator."

One of the major issues with the installation of a hybrid-access mechanism in smallcells is the cross-tier interference (intercell interference (ICI)) caused by the macrocell users (MUs) that are unable to establish a connection to the small-cell base station (SBS). In this paper, a joint strategy is proposed for hybrid-access small-cells using the Walsh???Hadamard transform (WHT) with NOMA and interference rejection combining (IRC) to achieve high performance gains and mitigate intercell interference (ICI), respectively. WHT is applied mathematically as an orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) to achieve diversity in communication systems. When applied jointly with NOMA, it ensures better performance gains than the conventional NOMA. It reduces the bit error rate (BER) and enhances subsequent throughput performance of the system. IRC is used at the receiver side for managing the cross-tier interference caused by MUs that are unable to connect to the small-cell base station (SBS) for hybrid-access. The work considers both ideal and nonideal successive interference cancellation (SIC) conditions for NOMA. Mathematical modeling is provided for the proposed joint strategy for HetNets and the results validate it in terms of BER and subsequent user throughput performance, compared to the conventional NOMA approach."

A dozen of studies have been conducted to make an automated arrhythmia detector. The classification approach ranges from using a simple rule-based model, traditional machine learning, to a modern deep-learning technique. However, comparing an arrhythmia classifier performance is not an easy task. There are several different datasets, classification standards, data splitting schemes, and metrics. To assess the real performance of the developed models, it is important to train and evaluate the model in a standardized method such as the result score can become standard too. In this study, a set of CNN models from Acharya were reimplemented by re-training and re-evaluating it in a more standardized method. The model uses a raw ECG waveform with 260 samples around the QRS peaks and classifies it into 5 arrhythmia classes. The experiment was conducted using 3 configurations, using both intra-patient and inter-patient schemes. The experimental results show good performance for the intra-patient scheme, but not for the inter-patient. There is a reduction of sensitivity and precision in the intra-patient scheme using a standardized method in this study compared to the original paper.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of deploying SD-WAN on mining enterprises' public links such as Direct Internet Access (DIA), fixed broadband, and 4G LTE, and private links, namely, Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) and Multi-Protocol Layer Switching (MPLS), by utilizing SD-WAN's architecture and scenarios testing with the head office in Jakarta and branch office in Balikpapan. The results obtained that SD-WAN works appropriately when one of the multiple links is down. Meanwhile, when multiple links are down, the SD-WAN can still access Voice over IP (VoIP) and video conference between the head office in Jakarta and branch office in Balikpapan."

Therefore, it requires along procedure to identify Parkin-son's disease and considerable risk of misdiagnosis. This study proposes automatic detection of Parkinson???s disease formed on gait analysis of Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) signals. The raw data of VGRF signals obtained from the Physionet database is filtered using a Butterworth high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.8 Hz. Afterward, the features were used based on the maximum amplitude value, the minimum amplitude value, and the maximum power value of VGRF signals after filtering. K-Nearest Neighbor was performed as a classifier to classify PD and healthy subjects. The total data used are 165 data that consists of 93 PD and 72 healthy subjects. The proposed model was evaluated using 42 test datasets and obtained a 77 AUC score by using the most optimal parameter of K-NN with K 7 and Chebyshev as a distance matrix. The performance of accuracy and AUC score obtained in classification was acceptable even though only used 3 features as input for the KNN classifier model. In addition, the proposed method simplifies the previous algorithm in detecting Parkinson's disease. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is very important; hence it can provide the proper treatments that can delay the disease progression."

Generally, the effort used to reduce stroke patients is the diagnostic method using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the cost of examination using the MRI method is relatively expensive and not portable. One solution to overcome this problem is to use an Electroencephalograph (EEG) device to detect stroke signals in the brain that measure electrical activity detecting abnormalities in the brain. This action uses special sensors, namely electrodes attached to the head and connected to the computer. In previous research, EEG stroke signal processing was carried out using the Brain Symmetry Index and Hilbert Huang Transform (BSI-HHT) methods. However, this study did not specifically discuss channel selection in EEG stroke signals. Given these problems, in this study, the authors will process the EEG stroke signal using the modified Spatial Selection method using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method through the active channel composition configuration so that it can be processed to obtain relevant results. Furthermore, the classification process is carried out using the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methods. Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification shows that the spatial selection method can find the suitable channel composition with the same accuracy results as normal data in several areas. In contrast, the ELM classification can increase accuracy by 2 greater than normal data in the high mean area with a few channel compositions."

The chaotic maps are used for watermarking medical images, which can provide protection and security on medical images. In the watermark image, a method is applied that will increase the security of the watermark image, namely Arnold's Cat Maps. SVD method is used to decompose input data into three sub-matrices. The embedding stage is carried out by combining the watermark image and the host image with the SURF-DCT-SVD method to produce a watermarked image. At the extraction stage, it will produce a watermark image from the watermarked image. In addition, various attacks were carried out against the proposed method. Experimental results show SVD can increase the robustness of DCT and SURF-based watermarking schemes. The proposed watermarking technique is resistant to JPEG compression attacks, noise addition, signal processing, and geometry attacks. In this study, the performance of the proposed method is also compared with other state-of-the-art techniques.

Compressive Sensing includes lossless compression which is a way to compress the size of a data without losing the original information. The medical image watermarking process is divided into two processes, namely the insertion process and the extraction process. The insertion process is carried out using the Spread Spectrum method with a Gaussian distributed PN code key, resulting in a watermarked image.

In the literature, it is said that there is an artificial method that frequently falls to the minimum local solution. The local minimum results are proof that the artificial method is not accurate. This paper proposes the Large to Small Area Technique for power system optimization, which works based on reducing feasible areas. This method can work accurately, which that never violates all constraints in reaching the optimal point. However, to conclude that this method is superior to others, logical arguments and tests with mathematical simulations are needed. This proposed method has been tested with 24 target points using ten functions consisting of a quadratic function and a first-order function. The results showed that this method has an average accuracy of 99.97 and an average computation time of 62 seconds.

The PS-pretreatment enhances the enzymatic digestibility to 77.0 (at 35 EGU cellulase and 30 U ??-glucosidase/g cellulose), 1.8- and 11.9-times higher than those of DS-pretreated and unpretreated OPEFB, respectively. This high effectiveness of PS-pretreatment provides a potential way towards economically feasible bioethanol production from OPEFB."

A photometer was used to determine the percent degradation of MB in the solutions. We obtained that the boiling treatment is more effective for enhancing the degradation ability of rice husk than sunbathing process. The use of boiled rice husks could reduce MB in the solutions up to 89 . Indeed, the degradation ability of rice IR 64-rice husk can be significantly increased through simple treatment so that it possesses a great chance to be developed as a green adsorbent with incredible performance."

In order to analyse it, we need a rainfall measuring device/rain gauge, as rainfall is an important parameter to find the correlation between the two. However, there is a limited number of rain-gauge in Indonesia. Thus, we proposed a tipping bucket rain gauge, which consists of a funnel, a bucket, a magnetic switch sensor, and a microcontroller-based processing unit. The prototype is equipped with a GSM module so that the data can be sent in real-time via text message every minute, also an SD Card as the backup storage data.

Currently, almost 55 of the world's population lives in urban areas and is projected to increase to 68 by 2050. Based on the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), the total time humans spend indoors is 86.9 . Research shows that air pollutants contained in indoor air are 2 to 5 times more than outdoor air. The neglect of the air conditioning system also worsens indoor air quality. It is often found that the supply of fresh air and the concentration of pollutants in the work or activity zone is unknown, even though this is a crucial matter. With the amount of time spent indoors, air quality and the distribution of pollutants in indoor air become very important. This research was conducted spatial modeling of air pollutant distribution using the kriging interpolation technique. The results of spatial modeling with this method produce an average of R-squared 70,98 dan RMSE 0.03.

However, this type of solar cell has the disadvantage due to its large band gap of 3.1 eV which generates low sun light absorption. To overcome this problem, the TiO2 is usually incorporated with dye or other nanoparticles. In this study, micro-sized graphite was inserted into anatase-TiO2 solar cells using the doctor blade and spin-coating methods. The morphology and the effect of graphite insertion on TiO2 to the absorption spectrum are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis, respectively. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar cell is determined from the I-V curve characterization. Generally the I-V curve characteristics is affected by the mass of graphite insertion, Even though the observed highest efficiency is 0.052 , the graphite insertion is found to increase the light absorption about 75 when 0.4 gram graphite is inserted to 0.7 gram TiO2 and deposited using doctor blade method. Furthermore, the I-V curve characteristics and efficiency can be modified by depositing the sample using spin coating method which tends to produce higher open circuit voltage and smaller short circuit method. A 350 mV open circuit voltage is observed for 1000 rpm spin coating. A higher efficiency is obtained for smaller rpm. This study shows how graphite insertion affects the light absorption and electrical properties of anatase-TiO2 based solar cell."

The presence of voids can affect the mechanical properties and increase the potential damage of the composite. Voids possess micrometer size and various shapes which requires micrometer resolution technique for identification. This study aims to identify, classify, and count the number of voids in resin-covered fiberglass composite digital images, as well as to correlate the voids with the composite tensile strength. For that purpose, we applied the template matching method in digital image processing combining with normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method to analyze the digital images of the composites prepared by dry-, wet-, and rolled- lay-up methods. We observed various shapes and sizes of voids present in the composite surface and correlate them with the composite tensile strength. Even though the specimens are prepared with the same fabrication processes, the number of voids on each specimen is varied. However, only voids with a diameter size larger than 70mm found to strongly influence the tensile strength. The composite tensile strength tends to decrease with the increase of large voids numbers whereas no consistent relation is observed between the number of small voids and tensile strength. We also found that RGB image templates are more accurate for localized void identification with a strong contrast with its surrounding. This study reveals the potential of digital image processing methods for identifying and characterizing various void geometries in composites."

As the vital region in Jakarta where the center of government and business are located, Central Jakarta is inseparable from the flood when the rainfall is remarkably high. Therefore, the Jakarta Provincial Government need a datadriven policy to facing potential flood that may occur each year to protect the citizen from the threat of flood disaster. Monthly rainfall prediction can be a reference to determine the possibility of considerable loss and damage due to disaster threats. However, at this moment, it is still challenging to find a fitting forecasting model for this context. This paper reports a comparison of three different time series models: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Facebook Prophet, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast monthly rainfall in Central Jakarta for up to two consecutive years. The result indicates that Facebook Prophet, with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), is the fittest model to predict the monthly rainfall in Central Jakarta. It shows that a high amount of rainfall will be seen in January and February 2021, which suggests we need to be prepared to anticipate the potential flood.

In addition, an LED spotlight system that can shoot light in the direction of the target is also proposed. The encoding process is done by making a unique blinking pattern on the LED, and thus the camera and a servomotor as an object recognition system would only recognize a unique marker given by an LED. In this work the camera with OpenCV could capture a unique marker in all variant of blinking patterns. A unique marker is important on object recognition system so the camera could identify the object marked by our unique marker and ignore all other markers that might captured by the camera. In addition, analysis of the PWM signal from an LED is carried out here to determine the characteristics of the LEDs in each color, determine the accuracy of the duty cycle, and the use of the bright-dim method on the LEDs. The results show that the highest accuracy is obtained when a 50 duty cycle is used with the on and off time are set to be 1 second for all LED colors. The benefit of the proposed system is confirmed by implementing an integrated control system as a unique marker. The effectiveness of the blinking LED against other laser interferences is also discussed."

Based on the above problems, we need a system capable of detecting ocean waves and providing early warning to the public. The system will be designed using the method na??ve Bayes to provide early warning to fishermen and coastal communities based on the parameters of the speed and height of sea waves connected to the Internet of things. Tests using na??ve Bayes have excellent accuracy performance between 98 to 100 ."

Rain prediction was developed using numerical models cannot predict rain accurately. Because of this reason, the rain prediction system was developed using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) method in this research. One thousand of cloud images from Garut sky were used for the training process. It consists of two categories, cloudy images and rain images, to build predictive models. The simulation process is carried out by inputting a cloud image through several processes such as preprocessing, feature extraction, and learning process, so this system can predict the rain in the next hour. The accuracy of this system can reach up to 98 obtained from the results of tests carried out such as 80:20 data partition, 0.001 learning rate, and 50 epoch.

Islamic boarding schools are education institutions that have been developing in Indonesia as places for the Indonesian people to learn and gain knowledge in the perspectives of the Islamic religion and Indonesian nationalism. This study aims to explore the potential of Islamic boarding schools as places to support and to empower the economy and to increase the participation of students in entrepreneurial activities by applying the Humane Entrepreneurship approach. This study identifies the humane entrepreneurship approach by analyzing the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle in the entrepreneurship activities occurring in a single case study of an Islamic boarding school. Design/Methodology/Approach ??? This article used a qualitative method with a case study approach through deep exploration and observation. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with the key people in one of the Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia using a purposive sampling technique. Miles and Huberman's (1984) technique was used for data analysis by grouping similar text segments into codes and categorizing them for further analysis. Findings ??? The findings of this study indicates that the Islamic boarding school has implemented humane entrepreneurship through entrepreneurial-oriented activities as the main aspects of the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle. The implementation of humane entrepreneurship aims to achieve entrepreneurial growth, innovation and independence of the Islamic boarding school, as well as the development of the stakeholder???s capabilities, knowledge and commitment. In addition, applying the spiritual approach, which is one of the important components of Islamic boarding schools, has proven to be effective in implementing humane entrepreneurship. Research Limitations/Implications ??? This study has several limitations. First, this study only focused on one Islamic boarding school in Indonesia. Second, there is still very little research in the field of humane entrepreneurship, so the concept itself is still considered to be relatively new. Therefore, further direction is needed for future research regarding the exploration and identification of any other factors that might influence humane entrepreneurship. Originality/Value ??? This study provides new insights on the implementation of humane entrepreneurship in Islamic boarding schools. This research covers the gap where the humane entrepreneurial approach can be applied not only in large organizations, but also in religious educational institutions. The spiritual approach and religious values as the principles of Islamic boarding schools have been proven to be effective in implementing humane entrepreneurship."

Previous studies have continuously examined the effect of HR practices on perceived organizational support and job satisfaction. This study, based on the social exchange and conservation of resources concept, will test the direct effect of HR practice on job satisfaction and the mediation of perceived organizational support in construction business. 205 useable responses were collected from a private construction in Jakarta. Data collected analzed using regression and Macro Process to determine the relationship and effect. We found that if human resources practices were effectively performed, employees will developo higher satisfaction. This relationship enhanced when employees also perceived stronger support from organization in doing their job. Proper planning, recruitment and selection, better training and development program, competitive compensations, challenging career can have significant impact on employees feeling and behavior. Further, study also show that perceived organizational support mediates the relationship between variables. Since we use cross-sectional data, therefore the generalization of the findings should be done with detail attention. Though, the study still provide new insight towards the importance of managing people in the business organization.

Namun sayangnya, pelatihan mengenai digital marketing masih sangat terbatas yang berdampak pada kurangnya wawasan para pemilik Industri Kecil Menengah (IKM) dalam memasarkan produknya. Maka dari itu, Universitas Telkom menugaskan seorang narasumber yang ahli di bidang digital marketing untuk membekali para pemilik IKM di industri kerajinan dan batik ini dalam menghadapi tantangan pemasaran di era industri 4.0. Dengan adanya acara ini, diharapkan para pemilik IKM dapat meningkatkan pengetahuan dan kemampuannya dalam memasarkan produknya melalui media social. Pengabdian kepada masyarakat (Abdimas) ini dilaksanakan pada tanggal 21 Oktober 2021 dengan memberikan seminar online melalui zoom yang dihadiri oleh 116 peserta yang terdiri dari pemilik IKM, perajin, akademisi, mahasiswa, PNS, dan pegiat industri kerajinan dan batik. Hasilnya mereka sangat menyukai materi yang disampaikan dan menginginkan sesi prakteknya dari materi digital marketing yang telah dibawakan.

However, designing an antenna that is suitable for WBAN applications is challenging as the antenna should has compact size, in addition to the ability to endure low power loss during transmission and has robust communication link. Thus, a miniaturized wearable Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) capable of radiating circularly polarized (CP) wave is designed. The antenna designing is done by using CST software. A total of 140 simulations is simulated in order to obtain the desired results. The DRA is used, together with conformal copper strips and miniaturized copper ground plane. The single point fed antenna is excited by a unique capital F-shaped conformal copper strips. The CP DRA offers a simulated Axial Ratio bandwidth below 3dB of ~23.85 , which is much greater than what has been reported in the previous work, with bandwidth of S11 below -10dB ~ 16.066 . In addition, the antenna designed in this research project managed to achieve an overlapped bandwidth of ~14.10 (6.9GHz - 7.94GHz). A prototype antenna is fabricated to validate the simulation result. Thus, the antenna design in this research will be helpful towards the evolution of the WBAN."

The main challenge in developing this application is how it is applied in real-time via a mobile phone. In this study, a system that is able to analyze stock trading is designed using several methods at once and is able to execute buying and selling automatically. This system works based on real-time stock data input from several companies that are the object of study. The system will calculate three moving average (MA) values of each company. These values will be used as a reference for analysis using an artificial intelligence method, namely a knowledge-based system. The knowledge which is used in this system is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) method and support resistance. MACD will work by comparing the three MA values of each company and then determining whether there is an instruction to make a sale or not. Meanwhile, resistance support works by comparing the three MA values with the current stock price, then determining whether there is an instruction to sell or not. Users can also set up the system to buy and sell automatically. From the test results of the proposed system, the results of MACD's instructions were 36 purchase instructions with 100 profit, and 54 sales instructions with 7.41 profit and 88.88 loss and 3.71 neither profit nor loss. Whereas for instructions from support resistance, 46 purchase instructions were generated with 100 profit, as well as 45 sales instructions with 37.78 profit and 6.67 loss and 55.55 neither profit nor loss. The proposed system can also provide real-time transaction notifications on the smart phone. With the proposed system, it is hoped that it can make it easier for users to buy/sell shares automatically while still considering the risk factor. Moreover, this system can provide learning for novice users in buying/selling shares."

The absence of information on the position of the parking lot makes the car driver take longer to find it. In multi-storey parking lots, officers cannot always monitor the available parking conditions directly so that prospective parking users do not know the position of the open parking space. In addition, many parking lots use automatic door latch, but no parking space information display. Parking system automation can be based on hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. To the best of our knowledge, no software-based framework is fully used on this system. Therefore, in this study, an automatic parking system based on camera sensors and software is proposed which is combined into an information system.

However, in this paper we observe that the omitting of the statistic of the source is inappropriate for compressed data. We use both practical compressed source of Indonesian text and artificial text having an extreme appearance probability ???0??? and ???1??? as the baseline compression. This new variable is expected to improve the error capability once the source statistic is known and do not change during the transmissions. We evaluate the performances of the proposed decoding in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performances under the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), block Rayleigh fading, and fast Rayleigh fading channels using a series of computer simulations. The results show that the proposed modified Repetition codes provide better BER performances under all channel models, where the improvement is linear to value.

In this work, the structure offers good efficiency as the RF switches are not embedded to the radiating patches. A dual-band slotted pattern reconfigurable antenna using EBG structure is designed and analyzed. The EBG patches are located at the right and left of the radiating edge of the antenna. The EBG is designed so that its surface wave of band gap covers the radiation of the antenna. As a result, the surface waves excited by the patch antenna are prohibited from propagating by the EBG and caused the radiation pattern to be tilted to another side. The operating frequency of the proposed antenna is 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz for the dual-band antenna.

Compressive Sensing (CS), as a method with a statistical approach in signal sampling, provides different output patterns based on information sources. Thus, it can be considered that CS can be used for feature extraction of compressed information. Methods: In this study, we proposed a novel texture extraction-based CS for lung cancer classification. We classify three types of lung cancer, including adenocarcinoma (ACA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and benign lung cancer (N). The classification is carried out based on texture extraction, which is processed in 2 stages, the first stage to detect N and the second to detect ACA and SCC. Result: The simulation results show that two-stage texture extraction can improve accuracy by an average of 84 . The proposed system is expected to be decision support in assisting clinical diagnosis. In terms of technical storage, this system can save memory resources. Conclusions: The proposed two-step texture extraction system combined with CS and KNN has succeeded in classifying lung cancer with high accuracy; the system can also save memory storage. It is necessary to examine the complexity of the proposed method so that it can be analyzed further. Keywords: classification, compressive sensing, extraction, texture, sparse"
